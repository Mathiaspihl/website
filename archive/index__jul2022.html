						I slept in this morning, it's a very long time that I slept so late! Yesterday was a family birthday party for H. Very nice atmosphere, but sometimes BBQ is a lot of work! Especially if you prepare two kinds of fishes (salmon and rainbow trout), shrimps, sausages, Lamb chops and pork tenderloin (marinated since yesterday), potatoes and bacon wrapped green asparagus...and probably something else I forget. It was just too much, the romanticised idea of loosely stand there with a glass of wine being relaxed just didn't happen. But it was nice that the result was OK and people seemed to enjoy it.

The other one is already printing, I will post a picture of the finished result.</span></i> - a new idea and design from scratch. The idea is to create a "cupboard shelfs support fixation". We have noticed that the shelf in the cupboard have issues supporting the weight (constantly more stuff in there) and we need a support.

					<p class="main">
						Yesterday was a very busy day at work, busier than my first day. It seemed that people started noticed that I was back then; a lot of unplanned calls for status updates.

						OK, first day back after holiday is done. It was a bit of getting used to, getting into the groove of working again. I had about a backlog of 1500 emails to work through. By the end of the day I had an OK grip of most of them. At least I think I have a plan, a list of priority, to focus on.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						By recommendations from J, we have started watching the TV series, it's one Amazon Prime, called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">"The Boys" </a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on IMDB.com.

					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I also took the time to work a little bit in the garden, the filter in the pond needed to be cleaned. I did a basic cleaning (my back felt a bit "strange" today and I listen to the signals) and some small stuff around in the garden. H. did most of the work, preparing it for a birthday family BBQ that we've planned for tomorrow.

						It's here, the last day of my holiday. Well, holiday #1 at least. I have to check for the upcoming holiday in Sweden as well, allt the documents needed for my passport and ID card that I reserved some 30 days ago.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I got the spareparts that I need to start with J's moped. It's an odd thing that I am doing, the clutch is not coming together as I expected. I am really not a mechanic enough to see what's going on and I need another night to figure it out. I had to adjust	 the parts I bought this morning, all went fine. Interesting work for sure and I learned something as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I wrote some more today, it went better than yesterday for sure. I could write now and then, so that was all good. For dinner we ordered Sushi and with it some really nice wine. All very nice!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I had a look at the laptop that J need for his studies. Interesting, I like to check it out, nothing special is needed though. The main thing is that it has to be <b><i>Microsoft Office</i></b> compatible - add about 1/3 of the costs thus.

						It was a strange and annoying day today. Nothing went according to plans. But really; nothing. The timing was simply not right in anything I did, everything was a "struggle", if you know what I mean. Simply; a shit day.

						A perfect example was the planned activity to finally fix the moped (this time it is the wire for the clutch that broke off some time back). First; the plan that J and I were doing it didn't happened (I'll just leave it with that, without any details) and then when I finally could go for the spareparts, the shop was closed...

All went so smooth - returning the car at Hertz, the check-in and flight back and finally getting the car back from the long-term parking at the airport in Belgium. Too smooth? I was just waiting for something to go wrong. But so far all went without a glitch. I say "So far", because I still have to get the final confirmation back from Hertz. Remember that "flat tire incident" I wrote earlier about; not sure if that whole "adventure" is included...

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Today, we are all "coming back to reality" - unpacking, off-loading and sorting all the pictures we took (must have been about 800 of them in total), updating family and friends and do all of that what "coming back to reality" implicates. Mostly practical stuff that no one wants to hear about... 
					</p>

						You might have noticed the pause in updates on the website. No drama, we went on holiday and I did not bring a laptop to work on the webpage. I figured there wouldn't be much time for it. Also, it's good with a little "holiday" from the "daily update" website...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We travelled to the Corfu island (in Greece of course) for 8 days of holiday. And what a holiday it was, a fantastic time. I was there about 25 years ago with my friend J and have only fond memories of it. How would it be coming back again? It was all perfect. In fact, it actually didn't change that much. The people are still extremely friendly, the pace is relaxed and the roads are really crap. 25 years ago we were driving around on mopeds, this time we drove around in a car. At times I missed the moped on the narrow and often unpaved mountain roads...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						We explored the island, enjoying the nature and the tourist attractions with a balanced schedule to also leave enough time for relaxing. We saw and experienced a lot, every day was an adventure of some sort. Everything from discovering new breathtaking beauty, flat tire in 40 degrees heat and to be completely lost in the middle of nowhere with the car. It was certainly a special time that I will cherish for the rest of my life...

						Tomorrow is a busy day, a lot of things to do arrange before we can leave on holiday. One worrying thing is that when we arrived home today our cat Mokka seems not to be feeling well. She doesn't want to eat too much and, I could be wrong, but it looks like she is swollen around one eye. I suspect that she was stung by a wasp. We will have to monitor it closely... 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, I am so tired after the excursion (and a very short night last night) today. It was fantastic weather - a lot of sun today. A quick check on Mokka and then time for bed

						Yesterday was the day we have been waiting for - J came home. It was of course great knowing that he enjoyed the time, kicking back relaxing and to just hanging with his friends without any worries and "musts". We were really happy for him and his friends. But still, egoistically seen, it's always the best feeling to have him back home.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I think that yesterday was the first day we had for our self. We enjoyed it to the fully!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						So, the car was fully charged (not that it was needed) for the 200+ km trip back and forth to Rotterdam airport. The flight was delayed by 1 hour and With some detour due to road constructions on A20 I arrived there at around 01:00. It was simply fantastic to see his face again. "Man, he is a handsome man", was my first thought with a heart filled with proudness.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The whole group looked like zombies, exhausted but very content and happy. We quickly loaded the car - all luggage fitted fine - and started the trip back. The trip back and dropping everyone off went smooth and we could go to bed just before 03:00
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						We have only begun hearing the stories. More stories to come, we have to be patience. It is very clear that it was for sure an eventful trip for sure. I am grateful that there were no more serious accidents than sprains, scratches and heartbreaks!

						I didn't have time to write about it any sooner, but we had a great day and evening yesterday! Friends passed by to pick us up for an adventure in Antwerp. First it was time for the escape room called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://antwerp.roomofriddles.com/en/">Room of Riddles</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Escape games in Antwerp. It was a really great game with such a fun group of people.</span></i>. Then after that we went for drinks in their "local café" - great place, great ambiance! Then it was time for restaurant. And that was a fantastic place called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://littlebeirut.be/">Little Beirut</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Fantastic restaurant, great food and almost magic atmosphere!</span></i>.

						I took it relaxed today, more or less I was forced to take it easy. We could talk with J in the evening. He had gone to sleep around 06:00, so that was the only option. <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-grin-tongue-wink"></i> It was GREAT to hear from him again...

						Woke up this morning completely rested, had a fantastic breakfast with wonderful cup of coffee out on the terrace. That is the opposite of Saturday morning. Still very nice, but had the feeling that I never really woke up. Nice breakfast on the terrace, but then the neighbour decided to cut the hedge. That's how it continued the busy Saturday - we had a wedding celebration to go to and then a combined birthday party in the evening. We have plans also today - meetup with friends in a Escape room/restaurant place in Antwerp.

						J. seems to have a great time. They enjoyed the beach, the weather and a café already. They also rented bikes and explored the neighbourhood and shops. Last we heard from him yesterday evening, they were preparing to go out clubbing. Hoping to hear from him, but I am sure it's much too early now...

There are also other interesting features and fixes like the "acceleration measurement and G-meter". This upgrade might also introduce a bug - tilting down of mirrors when in reverse mode - for some models. I didn't check this yet though...

						Some time ago I re-worked/updated the style here on my webpage. I introduced a new format and converted the pages as of 19th of June - any "daily update" posts before that will have a slightly different layout.

						So J left and the first phase of his trip started. I think it will be one of those trips he will remember for the rest of his life. Hopefully for the right reasons! Like my Interrail (times were different 30 years ago!!!) trip to Greece with my dear friend J. <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.interhome.be/spanje/costa-brava/lloret-de-mar/vakantiehuis-green-es9469.841.1/">The house </a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This is the house J and 7 of his friends have rented for a week.</span></i> they have rented looks very basic and typical Spanish.
