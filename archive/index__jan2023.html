						..And shmackabooom, we are in February all of a sudden! It's been a more relaxed day at work than yesterday when I had a whole day of remote "workshop". Following a meeting via webcam and headphone for 5 hours is not what I dream about...
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J and K were also staying here yesterday while I was 95% of the time busy in the meeting. But what matters is that they had a nice time together. It was the last time they could meet before spending a week apart - she is travelling to London and J to the Ardennes with friends. At lunch J left with a friend who drives the whole way there which is, as parents, always a worry! But he texted me saying that they all arrived there fine. Waiting for pictures now...

					<p class="main">
						I discovered that my little order for the Prusa mini+ 3D printer arrived.

I have already fitted the heat-sock on there and it fits perfectly! I started preparing for the Wifi-module; first step is to upgrade the firmware. The firmware and the bootloader were successfully flashed to the 3D printer. Now I just need to fit the hardware into the controlboard.

						I had some calls scheduled in the morning, but I was only able to join one of them as there was a production issue that I had to urgently work on. At that time the docking station to my laptop decided to do difficult. It just didn't want to connect to the keyboard, mouse and the screen. I had same issues before, also in the office. Not ideal situation when working on an urgent issue... Good news is, I think I found the solution of that business critical issue. And the docking station issue was also resolved.

So, to keep it nice (and the youngsters fed) we ordered food for tonight from one of our favourite - Gari Wok. It just arrived...

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We had a very nice evening yesterday, met up with friends in the restaurant called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.bistro-b23.be/nl">Bistro B23</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This is the restaurant we visited for the second time, but now with friend T and G. Nice food and a nice atmosphere.</span></i> in Antwerp.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We just heard on the news that a "firework bomb" (home made bomb) went off not far from where I live. Normally, nothing like that ever happens like that here. Apparently, it's got to do with rivalling drug gang settlement... A couple from The Netherlands was picked-up by the police. Recently there was in the news about a shooting here as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Buying a car is really a strange thing during the time of the motor show period. The fact that it's the first back again since two years (after the pandemic), doesn't make the hype any less.

						OK, so the craziness continues... Today, all happening in one day, we completed all the paperwork (3-5 instances and 100 of pages to scan and email) for the new car. Yes, we made all the decision and reasoning about and around all the if's and what's etc over the phone and phone. I have not yet seen the car!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						So, that was what happening and a lot of funny things around the car; like there were 3 other customers after H who wanted to buy the car right there and then. There are are only 5 of these cars for sale with these conditions in Belgium...stuff like that. So now we have one of the favourite cars of H as the second car, the Ford EcoSport.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						When all of this is going on, Balti contact us saying that they need to finalize the solar panel deal. That gets added on top of what we're dealing with. Of course. It's all great news and great progress. So now we have a date when they will come for the inspection, and when they will come for starting the installation. Then we were also contacted by the official inspection guy that need to come and declare everything. The date for that is arranged as well. By the end of Mars we have the solar panel installed and up and running!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						So, isn't it funny how all of that happens during ONE day? I have scanned more than 200 pages, in 16 different documents and emailed a number of, I lost the count, instances to get everything done in time. All should be OK now. Time will tell... 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Oh of course, J left this evening also to spend the night at his girlfriend in Antwerp as well to be sure that he is in time (they predicted snow and that brings traffic chaos) for his Excel exam tomorrow. But that is yet a another thing that was going on today...

						We already passed middle of Jan, almost February already. It's crazy how fast time goes. (I sound like a broken record). The last couple of days have been crazy much to do at work. It's typical that when I take my half days off, shit happens at work. So typical, that is what they call "Murphy's law".
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Something else that is typical (Murphy's lay all over again); we have just submitted all the paperwork concerning solar panel <i style="font-size:20px;" class="fa-solid fa-solar-panel"></i> to the bank this morning. Super exciting! Hopefully there are no problems. But anyways, guess what happens then? Of course our little car is dying which means another cost that we have to cover. The cost of fixing it is absolutely ridiculously high, it's almost the complete value of the 12 years old car <i style="font-size:25px; color:rgb(92, 91, 91);" class="fa-solid fa-car-side"></i>. I think we have decided to buy a new one... We started the research!

                        This weekend was not a typical weekend at all. J's birthday was far from normal, having to study most of the day through. Only in the evening there was some time for leisure - he went to the gym with friends. It continued in the same fashion today too... 
                    </p>

                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        I spent most of the weekend fiddling around with the network (some issues after the factory reset which Proximus decided to do when we had issues), the Raspberry Pi computers (found a new backup system called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://raspibackup.linux-tips-and-tricks.de/en/home/">RaspiBackup</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on the homepage of RaspiBackup. The solution that I found when being on Mastodon...</span></i>), finalizing the paperwork needed for the solar-panel installation (damn it's expensive), J's birthday as mentioned and other small chores around the house. Not much time at all for 3D printing unfortunately (except spending hours on trying to get Octoprint to work again, turned out it was also related to the previous network issues. Again).
                    </p>

                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        I am still finding the decentralized social network technology that Mastodon etc is, is a very interesting solution / community. Mastodon is part of the framework / solution that goes under the name of <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">read more on what's it all about on Wikipedia.</span></i> and it's a great technology and idea of how to create a secured network of a lot of small instances (servers of all sizes. I know of Mastodon instances that are hosted on Raspberry Pi computers).
                    </p>

                    <p class="main">
                        But the highlight of the weekend was J's birthday, how we still managed to make it very cozy and could enjoy a nice celebration for him. Just unreal how fast time flies though, I can't believe he was born 19 years ago (at precisely 13:26)!

                        To start off as I ended my last post; the call went fine. As it did for all the others. I have had a lot of them the last days and it's been busy at work. Luckily I have access to wonderful coffee here in the comfort of the home office. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        J has shifted his focus to the subject of the next exam, namely business English. He's got A LOT of material to go through in the limited time he has - only two days to prepare. Luckily he's brilliant in English!  
                    </p>

                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        One thing that I have to mention is what I discovered almost by accident is <b>Mastodon</b>. It is actually a surprise to be. It can easiest be explained as a social network like Facebook, but maybe more like Twitter. I have NEVER had Twitter and, for what ever reason, I have never felt the urge to use Twitter. Especially now with all the commotion going on there... Anyhow and nevertheless; let's get back to Mastodon. A lot can be said, I like the decentralized "blockchain" and open source technology that is behind it. Already there got me hooked. I have tried out a lot of alternatives in the passed - Google Wave, MeeWe and others, but it was never really the thing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        I got to know it through my favourite internet browser (Vivaldi, of course and the article is <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/news/vivaldi-social-a-new-mastodon-instance/">here</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Fantastic Internet browser and a great social service called Mastodon</span></i> ) and I found it interesting at once. One thing led to another and I fell for the small community called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://mastodonsweden.se/explore">MastodonSweden.se</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">A very nice Mastodon community called MastodonSweden.se. I am existing there as <b><i>@Mastodonten@mastodonsweden.se</i></b>. Already now I have some new digital friends that are very much in my liking. Refreshing to experience in the fake online reality of today...</span></i> All the communities (own servers and instances) are like islands that connects and creates the Mastodon federation... Fantastic idea!

						Ending of the workweek was tiresome - a lot at work, not feeling 100% fit and the weather was gray, rainy and windy <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy fa-fw"></i>. This period is just not a very inspiring time. <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-thumbs-down"></i>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It's a very interesting phase that our neighbour ladies are enduring as well. It's a very critical time at the moment. We are supporting them as much as we can...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Today I took the time to finally resolve a minor issue that I've had for some time with my domain URL. It was just a small thing not worth going into much details, but I found the reason (DNS conflicts between Namecheap and Netlify) and it is resolved. But, while I was in Netlify I did some looking around in the functions/services that they provide. There are a lot of interesting stuff there actually; one that I decided to implement is the automatic "Sitemap" generator. Once it's been created - while deploying - it also pushes it to Google. Really nice function! <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-thumbs-up fa-fw"></i>

						Another little update I also made to mathiaspihl.com is the contact form. Now you are able to send me messages directly from the site. It's just a matter of filling out <i class="tooltip"><a class="removelinkstyle" target="_self" href="https://mathiaspihl.com/index_stuff.html#contact">3 fields</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">From here you are able to send me small messages.</span></i> and click the submit button and away it goes. I also added it in the quick link menu (called Stuff) on the bottom right of this page.
