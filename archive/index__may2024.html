						OK, just a moment ago (irrelevant for you) I made some updates on this site. Notice the background image? For the person into detail you spot it at once. Yes, it is my fabulous 4 EUR mechanical keyboard from Temu you see in the background. So far, I am a fan of this little keyboard.

						OK, time to go to bed. I just had to make a quick update before I go horizontal.

					<p class="main">
						Another funny note, I received an order that I placed some time ago. It was a try-out I made, I actually fell for one of those Temu commercials you see here and there, this one was about a mechanical keyboard. I did some investigation about it and it looked good enough. I have always been interested in the retro mechanical keyboards - perfect for a laptop or any of the Raspberry Pi:s etc. I mean for 2 Euros the risk is very limited. The complete order was just over 10 EUR - I actually needed a couple of USB phone charger cables anyway - the minimum order amount. Thus, today I received it and I am using my nice 2 EUR keyboard when writing this post. It is actually really seems to be a decent little thing. I will provide photo evidence tomorrow...

Another important milestone was finalizing the travel arrangements for the summer trip - final payment, seat reservation and booking long-term parking. Satisfying items like that. H and I also took the time to prepare food, we made home made Italian-style meatballs (hand-rolled pork and beef meat mix and packed with spices, herbs, cheese etc) in ratatouille with pasta.

						I have again tried some attempts to post here, but just never came around doing it. I did however work on the site and I did update the Bookmarks page. Generally the work week was rather pleasant, busy but it was an inspiring week. It was also a week when the window cleaner decided (the evening before) to come. We have the window cleaner coming monthly, always on a Tuesday. But not this time. There would be absolutely no problem if we were given more than a couple of hours lead time. Especially if the day was planned to be somewhere else. It's a very friendly, cool guy though and I admire his view on professional life, "oh, today it feels like I want to work", kind of approach. Envy that!

						The work week started, yes due to the religious fantasy historical events it was a day off yesterday. Fine with me - a long weekend and a shorter work-week. Amen to that.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was a rather busy work day, catching up with emails here and there and it was an early call scheduled to start with as well. All good due to the prepared coffee with a light breakfast.

						Recently I have been hooked on the recent AI endeavours. It all started with the recent AI Presentation I attended. Well, only partly true to be honest. With all the AI focused functions which is being rolled out these days in my area of expertise. Seems everything is revolving around AI these days. Anyway, I am also hooked on the Ollama self-hosting framework freely available. I am so hooked in testing new AI models, most recently the Llava model with the image recognition capabilities. Fantastic! As an example, I asked AI to analyse and describe what it was seeing in one of the picture from my surveillance camera. It described perfectly; the background and the foreground, analysed the weather and shadows perfectly. I will see if I can show you a sample tomorrow. Now it is time to go to bed...

						As you notice, I am doing "a double update". I started writing this post two days ago but never got around to upload it. Keep in mind that the very last entry was written on Saturday and I have not changed it - check the timestamp of the post.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						On Saturday we went (the last attempt it ended with a car accident in early February last year) to&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin%E2%80%93Moretus_Museum">Plantin-Moretus museum</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">This is another fantastic hidden gem in Antwerp.</span></i>. It was really interesting to learn about something that had so much influence of world history<i class="fa-solid fa-building-columns fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #a26d10;"></i>. If you ever get the chance, I "urge" you to go and visit this hidden gem. Just shortly expressed; it is all about the work of the 16th-century printers Christophe Plantin and Jan Moretus who started up the world's biggest printing imperium and was basically unchanged for 9 generations (about 230 years thus). It was a fantastic day that ended brilliantly on my favourite place in Brasschaat, namely the airport<i class="fa-solid fa-plane fa-xl img-myicons"></i>. The weather turned nice and sunny and we decided to enjoy the moment together there with&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">a drink&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/ed/75/Wt34Dh2U_o.jpg" alt="drinks at airport">One of my favourite places at the local airport of Brasschaat</span></span> before we went home. Perfect timing as there were some activities (someone was practicing landing) going on with nice airplanes.

					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Sunday started out calm and relaxed. Slow start of the day. We did some minor chores and other stuff around the house. In the early evening we were invited to my parents in law for a birthday party - the mother in law's birthday. To be honest, I thought it was a strange concept of food (ordering the food from <i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://koperenpan.be/info">a place doing French fries</a><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-question"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">It's called a "Frietkot" and they are EVERYWHERE in Belgium. The fact that Fries is called "French fries" is soooo wrong! </span></i>. Yes, strange but it is VERY common in Belgium), but it actually turned out to be a really nice evening! We ordered the food<i class="fa-solid fa-burger fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #88513a;"></i>from a place called&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://koperenpan.be/info">Koperen Pan</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">A typical place/site in Belgium.</span></i>
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						And now...here we are, today is a bank holiday here. Great with a long weekend which makes a short work-week. Bonus! I will tell more about some 3D-printing I have done, but the youths are here now after the long weekend. Fantastic to see them again. Soon we'll enjoy a dinner together at home sharing all the stories from the last couple of days...<i class="fa-solid fa-person-praying fa-xl"></i>

						What a fantastic day it was today. Yesterday as well for that matter...and let's start there. We could meet up with our neighbour ladies for dinner. Yesterday, after a busy work day we had the luxury of enjoying the company of our dearest friends, our ladies. The preparation itself was a a post worthy with everything happened with the cooking - yes, I "helped" out in the kitchen. But even that was, to say the least, enjoyable and the story ("pepper perfection" [an internal joke]) was shared...

						It's been a different week so far. J. left for Antwerp and his busy week started. Then there is the wedding in K's family that they have to go to... Not an ideal timing, but that is how life goes I guess. Personally, I am trying to combine the schedules with my crazy work schedule that is intertwined with everything else.
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It's crazy how things changed post pandemic. Especially for me and how we work in my sector. Regularity and the 9-to-5 schedule ceased to exist completely. I started work more stretched out not taking any times into consideration. If you work remotely you always have to be available and prove that you're getting work done. Personally, I have never ever worked so much and been so productive and I never "slowed down". In fact, I have the feeling that I can not go back to how it used to be for the simple reason that I have the best schedule worked out, the work load would never allow it... Not without serious changes. Again.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Anyway, that were just some thoughts that's been occupying my mind recently. I am sure it started because I recently have been recognised for "a work well done"<i class="fa-solid fa-medal fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #f8b23a;"></i>. Today was a very nice day at work and I received some nice feedback as well. It has been a period when it just comes together effortlessly and goes smooth. I think we much too often forget to reflect the nice moments and see it as something normal. It is important to notice the good times as well...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Talking about smooth, all of a sudden the technician from the internet provider turns up and rings the doorbell asking if everything was done with the fiber installation. Anyone who followed that story knows that it has been going on ever since they first turned up digging down fiber in the street outside about 6 months ago. I remember how important it was to have a sketch ready showing the cabling... something no one ever looked at. Anyway, the 3 guys turned up started with the installation and 25 minutes later it was done<i class="fa-solid fa-gears fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #616161;"></i>. I think that the total work hours to get it installed from the beginning until the end was about 2 hours and 25 minutes effectively...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Now it's time to enjoy our TV series <i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21072112/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Bodkin</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">Read more about it on IMDB.</span></i>.

						We enjoyed the nice breakfast - with croissants and coffee - this sunny and clear morning. All of a sudden summer is here.
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Second half of the day yesterday we worked in the garden. The mission was to get all the collected rough-cut firewood, cut it up in right size and load into the firewood storage place outside. It was heavy but very nice work to be outside in the sun. The firewood storage shed had also been arranged to increase the capacity and better order. Now we have two separate entries to access the two separated areas. We got everything done, without the help of parents in-law we would have probably been busy today as well.  
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Today the plan is firstly to enjoy the garden - to harvest from all the work yesterday. Last night, after cleaning up after all the work, it was really nice&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">outside in the garden&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/29/90/mjbJo1Xe_o.jpg" alt="garden, flowers">The garden at night.

						...and today we enjoyed the garden! I think today we spent 95% outside - J. worked on school stuff and planning/guidance with H. as a lot is coming up next week. Smaller everyday chores throughout and some add-hoc things coming up as well, like moving the basketball hoop in the garden to a better&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">location&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/4f/b5/HhJ8dzvG_o.jpg" alt="garden, basketball hoop">An apple tree with a basketball hoop?

						There were nice couple of days - Thursday was an official bank holiday here and yesterday I was back to work to complete the work week. Even though it was a lot to jump into, it was worth it. Especially after spending a fantastic day with my family in Domburg in Zeeland, the Netherlands.

I am now printing with a&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.123-3d.nl/Polymaker-PolyTerra-PLA-filament-1-75-mm-Fossil-Grey-1-kg-70824-i7593-t7325.html">Fossil Gray</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">This is what I am printing with, bought from my favourite supplier.</span></i> and it is looking great!

						It was difficult getting up this morning for the early calls, just one of those days when it is more difficult to wake up than normal. The magic of coffee changed that in a jiffy... 
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I was looking forward to finally have the fibre installed - just the last to connect and the setup of the router. That was scheduled for yesterday (I have lost the count on when they are supposed to come), but as it happens, they never turned up. Not even a message. Will they come today? No one knows, it seems. Customer support is something rare these days. Generally, the quality of service is really decreasing. Not sure why, but I notice this everywhere across different companies and segments. It's almost an exception to met with a friendly face or receiving the basic level of quality. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						One company that really stand out providing excellent service, is the online 3D printing shop of choice,&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">I ordered<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg img-myicons"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/46/b3/SoijJX8F_o.jpg" alt="3D printing filament PLA PETG">Always deliver great service and offering nice products!

It was nicely delivered and I also had a little gift included. How nice is that? But that is why I keep ordering from them.

						Oh and just quickly, I just must mention the nice excursion last Sunday with the youths. As mentioned, we went to&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">the Royal botanic garden<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg img-myicons"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/0d/20/amiW4jg1_o.jpg" alt="Royal botanic garden brussels">The Royal Botanic garden in Brussels. Only open 2 weeks per year!</span></span> in Brussels. It was really nice to find this lush green oasis in the middle of Brussels with an interesting history (dating back to 1874) and a unique setup (with plants and flowers that are 200 years old). It was a fantastic day with a nice restaurant visit before going home.

						It's been a very nice day today, I had the time and energy to do a lot of stuff that I wanted to do that I previously did not had the time for. Most are things that need some concentration or a certain focus that you can't rush into. Not like those things when you "oh, I have an hour free, let's start doing some...". I am talking about things like writing, more 3D printing projects (I just love&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.multiboard.io/">the Multiboard project</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">This is just one of the most comprehensive projects out there, the pegboard system covering almost 1000 parts. FANTASTIC!</span></i>) and buying equipment (I have 3D printed so much recently that the filament is running out), researching some needed spare parts around the house (the tumble dryer need a new filter and the washing machine need a new front panel to the soap-dispenser etc). So I today I could take some time for the things that I have been putting off for some time. Fantastic. 
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was the same for H.(she's been the garden gnome, German tutor and shopping specialist today) and J. (studying was the main-goal for today). We calmly exchanged loving greetings when passing each other in the garage (my 3D printing corner is there) or when our paths met in the garden (when I need my Zen moments). It was all very, and now I am searching for the words, Zen-balanced day today.  
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I left off a working week still with the satisfying feeling of achievement and appreciation. Ideally we all need a good balance of that. I think that must be the things we (I certainly do) fear the most when retiring. Correct? Anyway, on Thursday I learned that I was nominated for a global-wide award<i class="fa-solid fa-award fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #f08c19;"></i>at work. I am keeping a down-to-earth view on it, but the most flattering feeling came from the person (who I respect the most at work) who nominated me. Enough about that now and we will see how it goes. By June I should know. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow we are going to&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.koninklijke-serres-royales.be/">the Royal Greenhouse of Laeken</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">I am looking forward to it so much. Not easy to get in there...</span></i> with J. and K. I am looking forward to it very much. It will be a whole day excursion with the 4 of us - the best!

						OK, we are in May already and that is officially a summer month, right? Where ever we are in Europe, now is it SUMMER. What ever you say, who ever you are, what ever religion and what ever... it is summer! <i class="fa-solid fa-sun fa-xl" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i>

						It's been a couple of days with 20-25 degrees (and that is according to Celsius), all of a sudden it was hot and humid. And no oxygen. Strange weather when celebrating (not really a proper celebration it here) Walpurgis Night.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Anyway... A lot of interesting stuff happened; on an everyday family-social level we had the birthday celebration of granny (on the mother's side) turning 94 years old. It was all nice and relaxed with a family gathering in the middle of the week. But also I have had the time to produce some real nice 3D printing projects (using the brilliant Open SCAD tool. More to come for sure!!!). More to come!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Just as a little side-note, but still a pretty cool thing that I want to mention, especially for my personal reference. Today I learned that I have been nominated for an achievement award (global level). What makes it special are the persons who nominated me and of course (an added bonus) it's nice with the substantial amount of money that's on the stake... We'll see. I am already happy with the acknowledgement (from people who I really respect) so far...
