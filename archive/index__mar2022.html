						It was a long time ago that I was this sick. It must have been when I was a kid and had the flu. That is at least the memory I have. I have as well Covid. I was not too surprised when I got the result back from the PCR test this morning. It was just a matter of time. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">

						Issues with J's originally scheduled flight back to Brussels yesterday due to Joe Biden's visit to Belgium. The fact that the US president was leaving for Poland yesterday around the same time as J's scheduled arrival in Brussels made it that it had to be rescheduled to an earlier time. A security measure these crazy times apparently. The problem was that was only discovered when they arrived in the airport in Barcelona... 5 hours too late. Luckily they had a new flight in the same day, but very late. At around 01:30 this morning we could pick him up at his school. It was great to see him home again safe.

						Very limited contact with J today, the most vital information was shared I guess. Seems he's doing great over there... Tomorrow I planned to go to the office. First time in such a long time. The problem is that I have important deliveries outstanding not delivered yet, maybe tomorrow? That is some of the new things that developed during the pandemic. Isn't that right? The new normal of always being available - work related, deliveries, phone. Always at disposal since we work from home. Imagine being too later for the doorbell in the morning when showering... I better shower before 08:00, the mailman MIGHT (never does, but you never know) turn up. Well, at home I can perfectly well combine everything. We've had some time to perfect it...

						It's been an eventful and long day today. Let's say, a very different day. We, most of us, got up at 06:30 to be on time with J for the bus leaving from his school at 08:00. They left for Rotterdam airport where they departed to Barcelona. Schiphol and Eindhoven in the Netherlands are the ones I have been to a couple of times, but never Rotterdam. It's apparently the 3rd biggest airport in the Netherlands.

					<p class="main">
						The when J left in the bus, we started with some planned projects around the house - J's room, the veranda and I also had a very special project that I feel a lot about. Going to a grocery store on a Sunday before 09:00 is completely new to me. Amazing discoveries!

						Antwerp was presented with great weather and the brilliant location <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188636-d501655-Reviews-Groenplaats-Antwerp_Antwerp_Province.html">Groenplaats</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Have a look here at Tripadvisor - information and pictures.</span></i> only added to the wonderful feeling. After the visit we took a stroll around on the nearby shopping street - J showed me some interesting brands/shops like Arte and Carhartt. Wonderful time with nice talks!

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I think that the program called "Internationaal Ondernemen" or possibly the program completely led in English called "International Entrepreneurship" were the programs he really liked the best! There was even one called "Supply Chain Management", which is exactly the business I have been working with for the last 20+ years.

I was however in need of coffee, J had friends over here before going out. It turned out to be a real treat - it ended up us speaking and laughing with the youth.

I have written articles about it and I can't stop praising it and the great functions that are available with the enormous amount of extensions available. Anyway as I mentioned, I made some tweaks and disabled some extensions that I am not using and installed some new. I feel that some of the extensions can cause conflicts and you get a limited function. You have to make sure you only use the extensions you really need. If you're not sure, start by disabling them. That's what I did thus and notice that the Fontawesome extension is really fantastic! I do not have to search for icons on the web anymore. Brilliant!

						I was checking out how to create forms, and especially how to best create fillable PDF <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> forms. Sure, you have the Google and Microsoft online forms. But I was especially interested in <i>standalone PDF files</i>. I found that the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.jotform.com">Jotform.com</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more on the Jotform site.</span></i> service fits the best. You can create online forms, but there is also a really great PDF form editor and the resulting PDF file can be downloaded. You have the option to create the PDF form with a submission function - it will send all the data to a predefined email address. The free version (registration is mandatory) gives you 5 forms (unlimited pages from what it seems).

						The coffee this morning was certainly needed. It was one of those days when it takes at least half a day to wake up. Is the reason that the quality of sleep wasn't the best due to the fact that the stars and planets <i style="color: yellow;" class="fas fa-star"></i> aren't in line, the balance in cosmos <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fas fa-user-astronaut"></i> was disturbed or simply just too little sleep....does it really matter? Sometimes we sleep less, the brain can't disconnect, just too much to process. Everyone has it at times. I heard that there is nothing such as suffering of sleep problems, it's just times when we don't sleep as good. It will pass, the key is to keep the usual times. The worst is to sleep in longer. It's better to simply get up as normal, stay tired and the quality of sleep will return. I can relate!

						OK, that's about that. It's been a busy working day and it seems it will continue like that for the rest of the week. J has a math test tomorrow and we took some time together for that today. It's covering statistics and he knows it perfectly. Theoretically he knows it amazingly well - all the 7 steps on needed for putting a frequency table together. The problem with that is he is getting overconfident and doesn't stick to the formal. Anyway, he's also got the test in French on Friday, two books (one in French) to complete by next week ...he's got enough to do. Like university and his future path...

						I have just executed the Polestar system software upgrade to <a href="https://www.polestar.com/us/manual/polestar-2/2022/article/softwareUpdates/">version 1.9.</a> I can not find too much details, one popular update was done on the <i>Rear Automatic Breaking</i> with better object tracking. Additionally the version 1.8.2 is included in this upgrade as well since it would only have been updated in workshops. I have just checked it, took a little trip as well. It seems all good, the upgrade was done without any hick-ups...
