						It's really into to very last hours of May, soon it's June. It's June already, it is supposed to be summer already. I just can't believe it! Normally, the summer holidays have been planned for a LONG time already, everything is set and it's the time of looking forward to those nice plans. None of that was done! We are still trying to figure out what to do in summer...

						We have been focusing on other things, it's special and exceptional times. Forget about the traditional routines, we just have to take it as it comes I guess.

						This morning the workers arrived to fix the roof. If you remember in February that after a heavy storm our roof was damaged. They did an emergency fix to stop any leakage and stopping it from getting any worse. That was in February and now we are almost June - 4 months after the clearance by the insurance company. Anyway, happy that it's getting fixed now - I can live with the loud noise! Hopefully they will not fall through he roof...

						J was out for an evening drive on his moped in the nice weather - it a great summer evening here - just enjoying. How nice is for him to go on an evening ride now and then. Clear his head from the content input by all that studying. I never ever had so much studying and preparation work as him. After todays work with math that he endured I can only admire the effort he actually put in. I get tired just thinking of it - he has already studied French, Geography and Aesthetics the last three days. And we have not really begun yet...

Started watching the Netflix mini-series called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12304420/">Clark</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Netflix mini-series about Clark Olofsson.</span></i>. Only 20 minutes in so far but it looks promising. Some preparation work with J for the upcoming exams period - Math and Physics. It's going to be a crazy couple of weeks that's for sure - 13 exams between 9th and 22nd of June!

Ink refill I should say, as the printer I have is an Epson ET-2721 with an ink eco-tank system. It just reminded me how good that system is and, foremost, how cost efficient it is. Unbelievably good and I can really recommend it if you are out looking for a new printer and tired of buying new ink cartridges every month!

						Yesterday we did some chores around the house and some little things in the garden. Getting the grass to grow evenly seems to be an impossible mission. We gave it another try - more grass seeds, cover slightly with soil and finally some minerals to boost the growing process. The final step was the cocktail of life - water. And a lot of it. We'll see how it goes... As long as the pigeons doesn't eat all the seeds it'll be fine. If those stupid little flying terrorists are not leaving crap on my car they are destroying the lawn.

J spent much longer time away before but this time it was just not easy to deal with. For what ever reason. Luckily all went OK, he slept most of the day between 11:30 and 17:30.

						Another day is running to it's end. But I wouldn't say it's just like any other day. It's important to make every day unique and appreciate the small things. Nothing should be taken for granted. That can be difficult to do some days, days when it's easier to fall into a rat-race. Those are the worst days. Today it was certainly not like any other day, not at all.

The whole school went there and it was a day full of activities - highland games and paintball. Then later in the evening I drove them home again so that they could get ready to go (by bicycles to the train station to catch the train) into Antwerp for further activities - more of the culinary sort. The conversations they have in the car is fantastic, I am happy to be a part of it!

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						H and I decided to go out for the evening. Initially both of us just had that mid-week feeling, questioning if we shouldn't better stay home today. But, I am glad we stuck to the plan of going out for the evening. It was a little bit like I mentioned earlier, to live more for the day. It was a great evening with nice food on the terrace of the restaurant. Even the sky cleared up, something I never expected to happen since the weather was terrible today with thunderstorms.

					<p class="main">
						We ended the evening watching a nice TV show called "Viva la Feta" which is about two hosts who spend two days with a famous person as a guest on a Greek island. Only seeing the dynamics between the hosts is great. Tonight it was the famous surgeon - someone who co-founded the Belgian branch of Doctors Without Borders - Reginald Moreels. He seems to be a fantastic person; such a humble open and honest person. Anyway, I wanted to leave with a quote he said:<br>

						I managed to squeeze in a 3D-print today - just a little 2 hours 3D-print. I have a little project that I am doing for H - designing a mini vase. I really like it since I have to use another program to make the design with, namely <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com">Tinkercad</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Tinkercad is free and completely an online system in which you create your designs.

Nice to do something with a complete new way of thinking. Very easy, once you get the hang of it. Anyway, the interesting is to make the 3D-printed objects water proof. By design, no 3D-print can ever be really water-proof without, what I think is the best solution, an Epoxy resin coating. I did my little investigation and ordered the kit today. It will be VERY interesting to see how it turns out...

It's been a very cool project, I learned so much and especially when it comes to all the stuff around owning - but really OWNING - a website. It starts when I investigated (all those YouTube clips, articles and just having those tentacles out there) all the hosting options. That is such a competitive market, it's unreal. Do I chose a payed or free service... the options are almost unlimited. Is it really needed to have a public website? Of course it is, in todays world you need to have one hook out there. Beyond all the social networks and internet services thrown at you for free... Learn and listen to this, those services are NEVER for free - those multinational giants are getting it all back on the cost of you. I have basically stopped updating my "social" life on social medias and moved it all into here. I am choosing what you see, on my terms and to provide you just that.

						It was a nice slow morning for obvious reasons, it was a very busy evening-night-morning. It started with a birthday celebration - grandmother in law's birthday. We met up and spend a nice evening with drinks in the garden and then dinner. J had the school gala ball <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap"></i> to go to. Extremely nice to see him getting ready, dressed up for the occasion. It's something special with white shirt, suit and bow tie. Especially if it's your son!

						Apparently the school gala ball was a magical time for J. It will be one of those moments that will stay in his memory forever. For him and his parents. That he was home at 03:30, shared most of his evening with us and that we finally could go back to bed about an hour later was not that important. Not even when we had to nag to get him in time for the guitar lesson this morning mad me really upset. I drove him there and could enjoy my walk in the park in the neighbourhood. Brilliant times!

I thought it was strange that the version number didn't change when I inspected in the Device Manager after a successful update...</span></i> that would make the processes easier - scan and update all outdated drivers. Looked promising and the reviews were all good. SO I ran the update, all looked good. Then today, when starting the Eneby 30 Bluetooth speaker for some music (we're listening to our favorit Swedish radio channel in the weekend) but the speaker was "blocked due to group policy". No matter what I did (via Control Panel and manually fiddling around in the registry etc), the issue persisted. "Long story short", I finally figured out that it was due to "Conflicting program Drivers"... It was all resolved when I manually uninstalled (with the option of removing the Drivers) it using the Device Manager. So there you go, shortcuts are often not the fastest solution...

						It's been 2 days of technical challenges. I upgraded <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint </a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The fantastic OctoPrint system. It truly changed the world of 3D printing!</span></i> - for anyone who knows what it means to upgrade a system based on Python - I had to upgrade from version 2 to 3. Then I also managed to resolve an issue that appeared all of a sudden. Of course it happens with everything else mentioned earlier. I believe I mentioned that OctoPrint system (what I use to manage my 3D printer) didn't boot. It was actually booting fine, it was not connecting to the network correctly. The issue was with the static IP adress assignment. Well, now it's dynamic and I am using a DNS name instead.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, that was a lot of technical details shared but that is actually what occupied my time/mind the last couple of days.

						It's been a typical work week day full of things. Coffee was needed for sure! J had a math test today (hopefully it went fine), H meeting up for a birthday surprise celebration in the evening. She had also foreseen a surprise farewell for her Swedish "colleagues" (not really colleagues per se, more exchange student program) she took care of during the time they spent in Belgium. They are now going back to Östersund with a lot of nice gifts personally foreseen by H.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Now when the moped is working fine, J is more mobile and can go easier as he pleases. Since nothing had to be prepared for school (more or less) he met up with friends for a swim. It's warm here so I can understand it must have been great to go to a friend for a dip in a pool.

					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						For the rest, I did not have the time to check Octoprint and why my Raspberry Pi is not booting up correctly. Hopefully tomorrow. I had an important/stressful call today which went fine. Happy about that since there were some key people attending and I was hosting it. All in all, a great day that I have to be grateful for.

						Interesting times... well, exclude all the shit that happens in Europe at the moment. Sometimes we just have to keep it at a distance. Try, at least. The trick to keep some sort of mental health is to decouple from al the negative input and stick to your hobbies and things that you love! I picked up my 3D printing.

I see it from a lot of companies. So, I start thinking of possible purchase, which got me thinking - filament, accessories or... maybe a new printer!? I started the research and it's been an interesting journey. Apart from that and by a coincident I noticed - one night when I said good night to my printer - that the filament had broken off. It can happen when it's not been used in a long time. Has it been that long??? So I started printing at once - I have already made two prints of which one is my own new design. I will come back to that one later. But I am buring of excitement starting the 3D printing and maybe invest in a new printer - a <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.creality3dofficial.eu/products/ender-5-pro-3d-printer">Creality </a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Creality is the brand of my printer and I am very happy with it.

I found a nice image at <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://pixabay.com/images/search/superman/">Pixabay</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Just an idea of what's available at Pixabay.</span></i> of Superman and merged it with the picture of the person. I made it in Gimp (one of the few fantastic free tools out there) in a couple of minutes. Most of the time was spent on actually finding the pictures. Fun to do!

						In parallel there are of course the daily life going on. Tomorrow J has a math test, the second this week. He also had an excursion yesterday for the physics assignment and the moped is also an ongoing project. One of few ongoing projects. The kind of projects that we all need to keep the sanity in a crazy time!

						J will spend the day in an amusement park called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.bobbejaanland.be/">Bobbejaanland </a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Check it out at the homepage of Bobbejaanland.</span></i> to do a Physics assignment. It's true, it was suggested by the physics teacher. It's actually a big assignment and the plan is to really do a good job to get some points to compensate the weak result in the previous test.

						I don't know about you, but I am getting a lot of calls from "Microsoft support". Obviously it's not really Microsoft support, they are all fake shenanigans. I can't believe that there are people falling for it. But it must be worth it, otherwise these people wouldn't continue. I have now started to have fun with it, trying with a new approach every time they call. It's a fun game. Just moments ago I asked them to specify which computer they needed access to. I was a very difficult customer and I finally said that I do not have a computer with Microsoft Windows installed. Next time I will speak extremely, but insanely slow to them. I also have some ideas in the future to actually setup a virtual computer and grant them remote access to it I will setup and then take control of their computer. A bit like how <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://bit.ly/3KHizmS">"Scammer Payback" </a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Watch this Youtube clip by <i>Scammer Payback</i>.

						I am still struggling to get my new laptop setup the way I want. The biggest issue is the poor quality of my Wi-Fi in the home-office area - the signal is not the best on the top floor. It's really terrible (which is strange as there are no issues with mobile phones etc) and it keeps disconnecting/reconnecting the whole time. It's especially a pain when you're on a VPN connection. So what I did to fix this back in the day (the early days of pandemic) was to install wired network in the home-office. It works perfectly, but you need of course to be able to connect the network cable in the device. Duh! It's more of a rule than exception these days that the network connection/connectivity is in the docking station. And I do not have a docking station yet. I resolved it by using the Wi-Fi extender/access point for a better/stronger signal. Until now it's been decent. Audio and video are still troublesome at times.

						J and I also squeezed in some math with math tutor friend M early afternoon. Tomorrow J has the first of two math tests in this week. It's of more theoretical nature, namely statistics. I find it rather interesting to be honest and it could be something that J could collect some extra point in. It's really important with a decent result, to build up a margin for his end report later on. It's all about strategy!

						We had a birthday celebration in the family yesterday - granny (on my mother in law's side) turned 92 years old. Her grand children and <i class="tooltipimg">great grand children <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/e9/21/3DSwVLT1_o.jpg">The great grandchildren in one pic.</span></i>  planned it and got together in an restaurant.

						We are in a new month and I think that means we are officially in summer time now, aren't we? Ongoing stuff in parallel are things like J's future post current school, growing and nurturing our lawn, new work laptop in my home office, fixing J's moped, next 3D printing project, upcoming summer holiday, request of my passport... things enough thus.
