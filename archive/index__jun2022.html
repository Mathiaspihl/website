						Tomorrow is the last day before J leaves to Spain for a week's holiday. We hope that we can do something with him before he leaves - it's easier for the parents who drives them to have all sleeping over there as they have to leave early in the morning to catch the flight.

						Tomorrow is the family celebration of J's graduation. It's still unreal, I think it's just been too much going on lately. Like his trip to Spain and the travel preparations - packing of clothes and stuff - started as well. Never-ending multi-tasking. At the same time we have a fantastic garden growing and, more or less, we discovered that beauty this evening when we took a stroll in it (to through away some kitchen waste). We stopped just for a second and saw the wine grapes, lemon plant and our growing olive tree <i style="font-size: 20px; color:green" class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i>. A little green haven within our reach! I will post some pics tomorrow, now time for bed...

					</p>
			
					<p class="main">
						On Saturday morning (he spends the night at friends because they have to leave around 03:00 am for the flight in Rotterdam) J will travel to Spain for a week on holiday with friends. It will certainly be a strange week for his parents! <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-surprise"></i> It's nice to know that he is travelling with such a nice group of friends.

Now the same company created a new tool - a tool for creating presentations. Much like the Microsoft Powerpoint. Powerpoint is great but it's huge and heavy in resources and you have to almost start a project for just a presentation - select a template, chose your media and then start writing the content ...and then some additional iterations of what I just explained before it's done. If you're lucky. When you're done you have a Powerpoint presentation ready to present. Nice, but if you want to share it, you have to export it to a format everyone can open. PDF is probably the best alternative due to it's portability. Anyways, the new product is simply called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://ia.net/presenter">Presenter</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Check it out here.</span></i>. At the moment only selected users can install it and it's also only for Mac computers. I have received a copy and I also have a Mac computer. I am really excited trying it out!

						It was a weekend full of activities that I will reflect more on when there is some more time, but just as a conclusion (but more because I want to get some content up here before I have to join a call), it was a weekend much better than I anticipated. An update follows, I have to leave now.

						If I start with Friday evening and the graduation ceremony specifically; it was really nice! They had arranged it to be light and the over all tone was with a humorous approached. At the reception we caught up and could talk with J, friends and acquaintances. J and friends left for a party shortly after and we didn't see him before 06:00 the following morning when he arrived from a whole night out...<i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-tired"></i> They had a great time, no one lost or hurt; so that was great!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">

					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Sunday started also with a tight schedule; this time we were going to visit our dear friends A and P outside Utrecht. Due to the pandemic and busy schedules we were not able to meet up in 3 years. It was really nice to catch up again, it was long overdue! From Utrecht (Vleuten to be specific) we drove directly to the next appointment - a BBQ that was arranged by the parents to J's friends. Again we hadn't seen J that day, but instead just met up with him at the place. We had a very nice time, over expectation. These kind of events can be very formal (if I formulate it diplomatic) and feel slow and stiff. But not this one, we really had a very nice time.

						Finally, the day we never thought would come is here. The very last exam was done and now the dreaded wait can start. We only know tomorrow night if he passed the exams and can graduate from the school...

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The last couple of days have been weird to say the least. To go straight to the core of the story, it all came down to that on Monday our dearest neighbour M asked if I couldn't drive them to the hospital. For a split second I didn't grasp the urgency, a second later I understood that it was really serious. To make a not very long story very short... 5 minutes later I'd changed into trousers (from the shorts I was wearing as I was throwing some balls with J in the garden) and was heading out to the car. When I saw neighbour D, reality hit me; indeed we need to get her to hospital fast! We finally arrived to the ER at 18:00 and ended up in one of the "boxes" there. All went fine, but something was seriously wrong with D. It took a long time, no conclusion was found and almost 8 hours later we could leave the intensive care unit and go home. D was finally in good hands and we could safely go home. We arrived home and I was in bed just before 03:00 in the morning. Tired but very happy!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						On Tuesday I was up and working at 07:00 again - at most 3-4 hours later. In the back of my head I was thinking about recent migraine memories... Anyway, at it again. Tuesday was fine for the rest, I was happy the work day finally came to an end. If I'd be really pick, it would have been perfect if I'd been able to sleep some more. Maybe it was because knowing the upcoming day - the last exam and hopefully the last active day for J in the school that he'd been in for the last 12 years...

						With that, I have to go to bed before I fall asleep and head-butt the keyboard!

If you think about it, it's almost to start laughing, but J discovered that the clutch "felt strange when shifting gears". I started looking at it and to my frustration, I discovered that the wire from the handle to the gearbox was in bad shape. Indeed, after I tried it out and did some checking it just broke off.

						Another very cool thing I started exploring is an online shop. I have two basic ideas - the print-on-demand (not 3D printing) concept for some design ideas. Another idea that I am exploring is selling some 3D printed objects that I have been developing. If I decide that it's not worth doing, at least I learned something new.

Is it even possible? Apparently not, OctoPi doesn't support it. but there is another way, namely Docker. Yes, there is a Docker-image of Octoprint that could be started up multiple times - each connecting to a printer. I started testing that out and it seems working just fine! Brilliant, now I can control both printers remotely with one Raspberry Pi.

						I was just think about what J said yesterday that today will be the last full school-day that he will have with his friends. They will never go out for lunch together like they normally do during school days, a special time for them when they - a very tight group of friends - can come together. After today they will hardly see each other anymore during the time of exams. Then when it's done, the ones who passes the exams will leave the school for ever continuing out in the world. It is a pretty big thing for them actually <i style="font-size: 20px; color: red;" class="fas fa-heart"></i>!

I had foreseen today as well in the planning, just in case something went wrong. I have been around before...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Today, while the others continue studying Chemistry, I am planning to finalize the Prusa printing calibration and print some stuff...if time allows. I'll have to do some final tweaking on the moped as well.

						It is still warm and sunny. Still? They predicted thunderstorms for today, but the sky is still blue and 25 Centigrades. It's actually a brilliant evening with a setting sun that gives that glow, it's like being in Spain or south of France.

						Yesterday was a day of assembling the new Prusa 3D printer. I bought the semi-assembled so it simplified the process dramatically. I could even give it a test run after it was done, I just had to do it to be able to sleep yesterday night. I found a nice place for it (I had to prepare and re-arrange a lot in my "creative corner" or "the man cave corner") in the garage. I did the first level calibration to go over the manual adjustment. Even though it has the PINDA system (automatic probing) it's a particular process that demands accuracy. All went fine, I got some basic 3D prints and I was seriously impressed. It's such a nice machine!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Today I have continued doing some calibrations, trying to figure out the manual adjustments on Y-axis as I am getting some "warping" and "adhesion" issues. I think I know what the root cause is - the nozzle is too far away from the printer bed (in relation to what the PINDA is reporting).   
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Anyway, the most time went to helping out J in assisting and guiding in studying math and physics. Priority #1 during these critical times.

						Unbelievable! I can not believe that we are already in June <i style="font-size: 20px; color: orange;" class="fas fa-sun"></i> !
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Today we received one, of two, exiting orders. For a long time I have known about <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.onfos.de/?___store=se&___from_store=default">Onfos </a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Swedish products shipped to anywhere in Europe out of Germany.</span></i>. It's a common place to buy Swedish stuff for Swedes that are living in Europe - expats and eurocrats alike. I remember in the early days when I had to find shops in obscure places that sold Swedish products (with long expiration dates). One could get really excited about "Leverpastej" in a tin can covered in dust. In the beginning that was really exotic. Back in the days when I used "Snus" - some 20 years ago - it really was a mission getting that stuff. First, when I lived in Brussels mainly, I had to drive to <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Belgium">Waterloo </a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about Waterloo on Wikipedia. It's a very interesting place where Napoleon fought a battle...</span></i> or alternatively to the "Swedish Seamen Church" (in the beginning it was located in the harbour area of Antwerp). These days you can find a lot in normal food shops. Especially the ones from The Netherlands. But anyway, back to the delivered package. It seems really well done, a huge box with a lot of nice (hopefully) eatable goodies in it.

					<p class="main">
						Coming to think about it, I still have to <i class="tooltipimg">open it <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/27/b5/W6vdG7rn_o.jpg">Check it out what was delivered today!</span></i>. I have to go and check it out now...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						<i class="fas fa-check fa-fw"></i>
						<i class="tooltip"><i style="font-size:20px;" class="fa fa-clock fa-fw"></i><span class="tooltiptext">22:19:11 CET</span></i>
						About the package from Onfos I mentioned earlier, it was absolutely incredible - delivered in time and fantastically packed. We ordered around 30 products in total, it came in one big box containing 4 smaller boxes. Two of which were considerably smaller. The biggest one of the two larger contained fridge products packed with cooling elements and wrapped in an insulating <i class="tooltipimg">"blanket" <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/b2/61/ifKIu8Vw_o.jpg">Look how well packed it was. Now it's almost all gone, not really but we ate from it this evening - herring and fresh boiled potatoes with the cheese called "Prästost"!</span></i>. Impeccable standard and service <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> !  
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						For the rest, it was very nice weather this evening. I cut the lawn... yes, it's growing. Good news. The flowers are in full bloom; trees and plants are lush and birds flying around chirping. The smell from the flowers, the sound of purling water from the pond makes the overall impression complete. It all comes perfectly together making it almost a magical labyrinth-like little garden. I took the advantage of it and moved my office out in the garden to write for the newsletter that I have to deliver. Luxury though!
