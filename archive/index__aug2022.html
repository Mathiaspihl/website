						The last day of August... the last summer month. It's reflecting also a bit in the weather; the forecast shows a couple of nice days ahead. I have a feeling the days are counted. We could still enjoy our coffee this morning on the terrace, but it was on the limit with T-shirt and shorts at 08:00 o'clock.
					<p class="main">
						Today was a more relaxed day at work, I could work through some of much needed administration. Let's see what tomorrow brings...
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						The biggest happening today was the purchase of a new laptop for J; which is needed for his studies. Both of us went to MediaMarkt (where else) to "check out what's available". I did some research (of course) and I had a clear view on what's needed - preferably an Intel i7, SSD harddisk (size not important) and at least 8 GB RAM. I want to be below 700 EUR. I found one but I wanted to go with J that he could see and feel <i class="tooltipimg"> it <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/c6/cd/Nq0OsNRG_o.png">This Asus seems really promising. All that I was looking for was there, it's very light and it's got Windows 11 Home installed.</span></i>. I even got J with me.  We, mostly J of course, did the initial setup and it all looks really promising. Extremely fast, responsive and complete for not even 580 EUR!
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I could also complete my latest request - a hook that hangs on internal water tubes. The <i class="tooltipimg">design <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/3e/d0/Je46TO6Q_o.jpg">It all starts with a drawing...</span></i> done and "transferred" it to FreeCad and it is being printed with my beloved Prusa printer. The simpler design was printed in 30 minutes and <i class="tooltipimg">the result <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/a7/69/qqx1gcYQ_o.jpg">I am really proud of the result, first design, first print turned out perfectly!</span></i> was great, we can now hang the towels. The soap dispenser "platform" is a <i class="tooltipimg">5 hours job <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/d5/68/lpId64yc_o.jpg">Hopefully it's as great as the first print!</span></i> for the little workhorse.
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						I just love the Octoprint-Raspberry Pi-Prusa setup that I did, it works perfectly. Today I had the chance to completely test it. It's just FANTASTIC!

						It was an extremely busy day at work today! Crazy many calls! I think I only had about 1 hour free today (including lunch) until around 18:00 (first call was at 08:30 and the preparation took at least an hour)... 11 hours work day feels, more or less, like normal these days. 60 to 65 hours work week thus. Hang on, according to my contract I do 30 hours "overtime"...
					<p class="main">
						We worked on our wine cellar today. We have 44 bottle of wines in our virtual wine cellar (with the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.vivino.com">Vivino</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">A very nice app/service all about Wines.</span></i> application) so far. And that is the "fine wines". One of the perks of life... We need to little things in life that makes it all worth while!

						Today was/is a typical Sunday - the kind I like. I could relaxed enjoy the coffee on the terrace, nice breakfast and then plan the day ahead. I had a lot of things already planned out in my head. As much Raspberry pi/3D printing as possible! 
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I think that all of us were doing stuff we felt like doing. Now and then we came together and had the much needed close connecting moments. Wonderful! Some of the strategical future planning talks with J. I guess it's more of "planting the seed" in his head and then we have to leave it, give it some space to grow.
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						Then, through out the day, I worked on getting the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://sendvid.com/z1npjf0y">Prusa 3d printer - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 w - Camera module v2.1</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">OK, I uploaded the clip to a service for the first time.

It was a lot of work, but it works great. The OctoPrint installation is something I am used to, so I am familiar enough to resolve any issues during the installation process.

						It's a lot of stuff that needs to be done when coming back from a week away. This time it was different from a traditional holiday (like the one we had in Corfu etc) since it was partly of social- and administrational type (handling of passport and ID card). Unpacking and sorting stuff out takes time - I am hoping we can have some "time off" as well to properly "land".

I say "some oxygen" as it's still a humid and thunderstorm-in-the-air feeling...

						Another interesting thing that I have to explore is NFC - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">Near-field Communication</a> - and NFC tag to be specific. It's very cheap small devices (you can get them for <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/nfc-tags/s?k=nfc+tags">under 0,5 EUR</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">To give you an idea of price and what it is, check out the search on Amazon.com.</span></i> each) that you can program, store 500 bytes of data onto (depending of type, the nfc215 capacity is 504 bytes). Let's say that you want to store a business card worth of data - should be  probably around 200 bytes of data. Then there are mobile phones that are NFC-ready to read it, the only thing you need to do is to be close (within max 5 cm or so) and the data is transferred over to the phone. How cool is that, imagine what a nice business card you can make. I am thinking of 3D print one, insert a NFC-tag and you have the coolest business card around.

						After an relaxed morning, I decided to take the "bull by the horn" and do the last bit of "holiday administration" necessary for the Sweden trip. These days, due to the pandemic, I have to best get the passport and international ID card done in Sweden. The consulates are not doing it anymore in Brussels. I mentioned earlier how it's mandatory to book an appointment - I was lucky that I could change my time slot to match with the already booked visit in Sweden. Anyway, for that critical appointment I need to have some paperwork prepared, if I miss something it could result in rejecting my request...<i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-surprise fa-fw"></i>

						After almost 2 hours of "paperwork" (it also led to other things that needed some attention), I tried to do some chores outside in the garden, but it's a struggle in the extreme heat. A lot of the hardware doesn't operate very good in these conditions, like an airpump we use to inflate air in the little pool. Not sure if air is escaping or if it's due to the ...yes you guessed it, the extreme heat!

						OK, just to mention; we had a great evening and night. I like it, no sorry, I love it so much when all of us can enjoy the time. Relaxed. When the evening turns into night and there is this relaxed feeling and all of us are just ...well, we all come together and it's chill. That is how it was this night. Wonderful! Enjoying a <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995832/">movie</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">"Generation Kill" seems to be a great movie. Have a look at IMDB.com.</span></i> together and the talks that it inspires. It's all just fantastic to be honest!

						Tomorrow is the last day before holiday. Great, but also very stressful! So much needs to be done before logging out, shutting down the "put the laptop in holiday mode". Not to mention, putting me in holiday mode... This time is completely different; this time is going to Sweden seeing family and friends. On a different level. We'll see, it's the last stretch before the yearly start-up, but it will be completely different from all other yearly start-ups...except that it happens to be post-Covid this time. But OK, all very exiting and we will see what it brings this time.

It's a "new" Linux distribution <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fab fa-linux"></i> called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://zorin.com/os/">Zorin</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Head over to Zorin OS, it seems to be great!</span></i>. OK, for me it's not super new, it's based on Ubuntu (that is why I jumped on it) and it really seems great as far as what I have seen. I will absolutely do a lot of updates about it here...MORE to come! The thing though, something that I have to let you know; do NOT start the installation when you are about to go to bed...

						I was up and about early this morning ready for work - in the office in Brussels. The plan was to take the first call in the car while driving. Technology was not with me though, I could never connect. Anyway, not too much of an issue. But still annoying!

						Now it's Friday and I am trying to enjoy the upcoming weekend. Sometimes when tired it's difficult to look forward when there are too much planned...but in the end it turns out just fine. Can't believe that next Wednesday it's already time for my holiday number 2! First a couple of days "landing" and then we're off for Sweden for a week. I love the idea of having a couple of days before and after the trip off as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Now... we are enjoying a glass (or two) of bubbles. Nice to have a relaxed evening!

						J's Zippo lighter (no, he doesn't smoke) stopped working, we figured out, due to the fact that the flint ran out.

There are a lot of interesting unique things around it still today, like the specific date code on the bottom of the case - all are stamped with the date when it was made - depending on the period when it was created.
