						OK, I did not do an update yesterday as planned, the last day of March. I'll come back to that soon. Today it's already the 1st of April and I have to make a monthly update soon - I reckon this post will live both on the March- and as well in the April pages.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I am enjoying the coffee tremendously today, the first day of April. I can appreciate the slow start today after the busy work week behind me. I can take the time to sit and fiddle with stuff and doing some research while sipping coffee to the nice music that is playing in the background.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday, the last day of March, ended very nice. Loads of stuff happened unplanned and the things that were planned changed or turned out differently. Very unpredicable, to say the least. After an eventful workday in the office in Brussels I drove home in crazy traffic. J arrived home with girlfriend K from being in Antwerp 2 days and one exam. They had a party to go to in the evening. Everything around kept changing (I spare you the details) and in the end the boys ended up here and the girls at someone elses place but met up later in the place they needed to be for the party. During the evening J's friends kept coming, my brother in law K suddenly arrived (we missed his SMS so he almost ended up in the veranda where the boys were sitting, thinking it was one of the friends arriving). It was very nice with the spontanous chat and a glass of wine. Much later than expected we could finally enjoy our homemade pasta.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						This morning we learned that the youth arrived around 3 in the morning, the oldies were already long time at sleep. Today we are all going to a family birthday party. Can be a very interesting, for sure very loud, evening. Night. Morning...

						So, today was one of THOSE days, if you know what I mean. I had to struggle with everything, it was simply a heavy working day. The ones that you just want to forget about after it's done. Not in the sense that anything went terribly wrong, just that it was a lot of heavy lifting. Feet placed up high and just acknowledge that it was one of those days, but glad that it's over and hope tomorrow is easier...

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Talking about tomorrow, we have the inspector over for the heater/boiler and chimney. Remeber? Last time he was late and thought that it was only to inspect the heater/boiler. You guessed it, he/they are comming tomorrow to do the inspection.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						The last couple of days have been days close as a family. The 3 of us were close and did everything together - talking, laughing, studying (indirectly of course), eating and watching Netflix etc. Very nice! Tonight he left for Antwerp and his girlfriend. Fantastic for him to have his time of course, but it's always sentimental, in the most positive kind of way of course. If that make sense?!

						The workday is over and we can enjoy the evening. All three of us. J has a very difficult exame behind him, on to the next one - French. Baguette! It's a good day, we have things to celebrate.

						Another interesting thing is the progress of J's project. I think I mentioned it, but just as a recap, they have started to actually selling their product and activly started to marketing the product. Really interesting to follow it and, but only in the background, being a part of. I think thay have almost reached their break-even target already. They are actually making sales!

						I am especially enjoying the coffee today! Why can we not just stop the hazzle with the daylight saving time? Last night/this morning Europe turned the clocks forward 1 hour as well. To confuse just a little bit more US did it 2 weeks ago already. It's just a mess when you're trying to arange a call and have to take that into consideration. "Losing" that hour in the morning is always painful.

					<p class="main">
						OK, so the day started with rain and gray skies, it's a typical stay-inside-and-try-to-stay-awake kind of a day. Hopefully, I can continue on my writing projects... Let's see what the day brings.

						Some interesting developments happening yesterday, it all started when we received the news that J failed terribly on a test, he missed on one formula which resulted in a terrible overall result. I still have problems receiving those kind of news! Then J had a friend that stayed for a little while and then later in the night he had friends over on a little get together. So, no real time to talk.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						This weekend is a study weekend for J, but he then received information that he needs to be in a shopping mall to promote their product for their business project. Of course that has to happen today - the panic is a fact, no real time for it. There will be some late study nights! 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						On the risk of sounding like a broken record, I have written about it earlier number of times, it is interesting how true it is that <i>bad news rarely comes alone</i>. It is like the saying "when it rains it pours down". Or the Swedish saying "en olycka kommer sällan ensam". I have plenty of recent examples that proves that statement...

					</p>
					<p class="main">
						J and H are both home since a while back. H had to go to help someone out with German (yes, she is a wiz in languages). I went and got J at the shopping mall around 15:00 o'clock. It was interesting to see him in "action" at the stand with the project group selling their product.

						Today was a productive day at work, but still relaxed. I could take the time to focus on the things that had to be done today. I could do it only because I decided last second to work from home, sounds maybe strange, but there was no time to get to the office.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Today is homemade burger day...and I am the grillmaster. I actually really like it, cooking the meat or doing BBQ is really something I like to do. It seems to be a family thing - my younger brother is hooked on BBQ (he is doing it year around).
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Today I could also do some small 3D printing - I did a little cable tie print to test out the flexible filament. It turned out great. I could also do a bigger one after that, once I saw that the printer was OK, I started a vise protection 3D print. It was a perfect 3d print (quality and functional wise) and it fitted just perfectly on the vise that I once got from my dad.

						So that was the initial and practical view of things. Driving back in my new old car with my Spotify playlist playing, seats adjusted just perfectly to my back (more than important for a herniated back patient). But, if you think about it, it is not just about the nice superficial things, it also about what happened - the accident. It is still something that happened outside the grasp of my reality. Anyway, it is about getting back to the normality again. It is weird that something as unimportant as a different car means other habits, new adaptions and other things that influences life in the end. And now it is back to how it used to be again. But now it is charging on solar energy. Another change...

						OK, so that was the weekend then... really, how fast can two days go? It was just a great weekend and Friday evening we were invited for an evening at H's brother's family - my brother in law thus. It was really nice, an evening just to connect and talk. Except the talks, food and drinks were important ingrediencies of course.

						3D printing; I have started a really funny 3D print job/-project. Funny is maybe a too strong word at this very moment. The print job consists of three object, one of them need to be printed in TPU - a flexible filament. A rubber like-object thus. Two of the three objects printed perfectly - an airplane and a airplane launcher. The third object is the <i class="tooltipimg">bellow stomping thing <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/ce/d1/R12gVjog_o.png">Cool thing to print and it's in a completely new filament type for me, but at the moment it is causing a lot of issues...

						It's really nice that we reached Friday, we are already over halfway into March. Crazy!  It is especially nice after the rough ending of the workday yesterday. It was already a heavy scheduled afternoon with 3 calls, 2 conflicting each other. Then in the middle of a call, goes down. It is especially painful since it is a system I am the owner of. The hell broke loose! Luckily I have a great team to work with and in 30 minutes it's back up again. But the aftermath and admin follow-up is ongoing.

						I ordered some filaments - always nice to investigate and order filament - for the 3D printers <img src="/images/3d-printer.svg" width="30px">.

						It was a very early morning today, we got an SMS late last night that the inspector (for the solar system installation) would come by between 06:45 and 07:45 in the morning. He arrived at 07:00 and we were ready for him with coffee. Was it the coffee or a good installation (or combination of both), but it was approved and he was back out in the snow again in 30 minutes.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It's interesting, every time when there is someone working with electrical installation or phone systems I think back to school when we had this work life experience program ("PRYO" or "PRAO", as it was called) and I was placed in the state owned telecommunication corporation called "Televerket" (it was state owned <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Televerket_(Sweden)">until 1993</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about how "Televerket" state owned company started 1853 and transformed into private ownership in 1993.</span></i>) for a couple of weeks. I thought I'd received the worst place, but I was to be very surprised. I could work together with a cool guy and come with him in the car visiting people for servicing phones or installations. Often we went to very remote places. We even went out with a boat in the archipelago to people living on islands... it was great! 
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow we have another appointment, another inspector coming over. This time it's to have the heater and chimney inspected. On Friday it might be that my car is ready...

					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Now and then I get some emails sent through the contact form on this site of various value. One person (I do not think it's a robot due to the safety features implemented) keeps ask me about "my price". Interesting thing is that it's in a different language every time. I conclude it is someone who found out about the Google translate service.
					</p>

						Anyway, today a friendly soul sent me some very kind words along with a great tip (which I added on my bookmarks page). Thanks a lot my mystery friend K.

						By accident I came across, like you do, a great Youtube clip.

						The workweek started rather relaxed at work, it was my cold that made it somewhat of a challenge. It's not too bad, it's more of an annoyance having a flu, sleeping bad, painful joints, coughing and having to run and blow the nose constantly. I actually did another Covid test today, it's still negative, as it feels worse today than previous. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I saw an <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.dn.se/sverige/alex-schulman-nu-visar-det-sig-att-anders-tegnell-hade-ratt-hela-tiden/">article today</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">I was always pro Anders and the Swedish approach in fighting the Covid pandemic.

He was often criticized for his unique approach on how Sweden dealt with fighting the pandemic. Now, retrospectively it is clear that he was actually right, his tactic was the most efficient and resulted in the country that had the lowest fatality number.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						This week can be interesting. I mentioned that my car might be repaired (I don't put my hopes up too much), but we also have an appointment to have someone passing by to officially do the inspection of the solarpanel installation. According to Belgium legislation it has to be approved by officials - paperwork and administration at it's best. Then on Thursday we have an official coming over to check the chimney and heat installation. Another official thing that need to happen for the home insurance.

						It was a, more or less, typical Sunday. We all stayed home today doing chores around the house and some of us are busy with schoolwork. We could enjoy a cozy breakfast, fantastic cups of coffee (no breakfast without the cup of goodness) and talks that we only have time for on these day.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It is an extremely nice family day today, a real energy boost, charging our batteries (not at all a reference to our solar panel batteries or batteries in my EV...) and connecting as family. J has done a lot of work - for different projects - for school yesterday and today.

						We have planned the schedule of next week. It is absolutely necessary in a family with everyone having their own schedules and parallel lives in a busy workweek that we are all leading. Talking of which, it will be interesting if my car is done, it was promised to be repaired in the first week of March. I have really missed it and I am curious how it's going to feel getting it back, will it be the same driving it, will it feel the same...

						The last couple of days I have been monitoring the solarpanels installation. I think it is really fascinating. I was lucky of having two days of full sun and it was charging with 3.7 kW. With that rate the batteries are fully charged at around 13:30. I have been using sun energy 100% so far. Fantastic! Today however, it's another story, the sun went away on holiday, nowhere to be found. Interestingly, the solarpanels are still producing <i class="tooltipimg">enough energy <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/30/23/QnstPlJP_o.jpg">Very interesting to follow along how the solarpanels are performing, what we are consuming and the overall status.</span></i> for consumption, charging of the batteries and give back to the net.
