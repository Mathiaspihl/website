						OK, so I am slowly coming back to the living. No, not that dramatic, but I have been sick the last days and I feel that the peak was reached.

						I have a fantastic Christmas celebration time behind me. A sign that Christmas is over is when my Christmas themed pullover is going back in the cupboard for this year. It was truly a nice family time <i style="font-size:20px;" class="fa-solid fa-people-roof"></i>, were we took the time for connecting as a family but also time for relaxing.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I could write a little bit yesterday, some time went to chores as well - a typical "stay inside due to shit weather" day. In the evening neighbour lady M came over for dinner. The progress so far in the treatment is going according to plan and we have entered into a very critical time - seeing how well the stem cell transplant is going- for lady D. A stressful and heavy time for everyone involved for a good result and especially a tough fight for lady D. for sure! 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Today will go in the sign of getting things done - work, chores and study are the main topics to focus on. Maybe there will be some time to start some updates on my little 3D printing corner - I bought some tool panels (Skådis from IKEA) to install. But for that I need to re-organise the printers a little bit. I am really excited about that upgrade...

						Merry Christmas everyone! No I am not senile (just yet), I know I started the last post the same, but today we are celebrating Christmas as well. For us it's became the "real Christmas" celebration. I have downloaded the needed the Christmas movies (the end of "Julkalendern", "Karl-Bertils Jul" and, maybe the most important, Donald Duck and his friends Christmas celebration that I wrote about yesterday).
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We are busy eating and drinking nice stuff. It is strange that the huge order containing Swedish Christmas food from Onfos did not arrive yet. I wrote about them before, I was praising how professional they were, how it was a German quality. But this time seems to be a drastic turn for the worse <i style="font-size: 20px;color: crimson;" class="far fa-angry fa-fw"></i>. We'll probably eat Christmas food in March...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We are alternating the eating, drinking and handing out Christmas gifts with studying. Well, J is doing the studying and his parents are in charge for the Christmas atmosphere... 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I am pretty happy with the amount of 3D printing I have managed to squeeze in lately. It's the intention that I will post some pics soon, but some of it I can't show just yet as it could ruin the surprises...

						Another "what a strange day again" today. I am not sure how many times we have said that the last couple of days, but that is really how it's been lately. I guess it's again a shift in everybody's life pattern. Everyone that matters the most and who has to biggest influence in our life's. J's life is changing as he is with the girl more and more and they are creating their own new life patterns together. As a teenager entering adulthood means a lot of "trial and error" and "finding out as one goes". That mean that the parents are more and more pushed out in periphery. I guess it's the natural order, but it doesn't make it any easier for us the parents.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Except another busy day at work, I continued some interesting 3D printing projects of which one completed very successfully. I will for sure post some pics of it later on. But for now, I really have to go to bed and get some sleep. I will do that now...

						It was truly and honestly a busy working day today, started early by answering emails before 07:00. I had an important meeting at 08:30, but it was confirmed cancelled at the very last moment. Annoying at first, but I used the time for another call.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						That is a little bit how the whole day turned out to be. I could report out a positive progress about the last couple of days activities. But that was apparently not enough to deal with, an issue appeared that affected production systems in the evening too. Anyways, the point is just that it's so typical it always happens on the last day before time off.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Indeed, I have taken the day off tomorrow for one reason and one reason alone. Tomorrow we celebrate 20 years marriage and apparently, I didn't know, but that is apparently a very critical time. Googling it is a very depressing reading. 95% of it is all about what you hate and can't stand about the partner. Luckily, that was something we've already been through. It was absolutely not the easiest of times, but maybe something needed to be able to grow and continue.
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						I guess the message is to be realistic, stand your grounds, have an open conversation with respect and be true to each other with open cards and remember that it is a dialog.

						It was a heavy day today, difficult to wake up and work started early. Then later, at 09:00 CET, I had a pretty important call as well and I needed to focus. The coffee saved my life.
					</p>
				
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I was just checking out the ChatGDP AI (an artificial online service) service that anyone can sign up for and use. At the moment of writing this the chat function is free of charge. I am hower certain that that will change soon. Anyway, I tried it out by asking it to write me a good Out Of Office email message; it did it really really well. I actually will use it as my future OoO message template.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I took a step further, and tried something else; I asked it to write me a blog post based on some key instructions. Very basic, this was the instructions I provided:
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-style: italic; color: darkgreen;">
						write a blog post on what happened today - I worked out of my home office and managed to squeeze in some 3D printing in between. I also did some Christmas shopping on my way home.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						This is the result:
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px;">
						Today, I had a busy but productive day working from my home office. I was able to focus and get a lot done without the usual distractions of a busy workplace.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px;">
						In between work, I managed to squeeze in some time for my favorite hobby - 3D printing. I find it to be a great way to unwind and it's always satisfying to see an idea come to life in physical form.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 40px;">
						After work, I decided to tackle some of my Christmas shopping. I made a list of the gifts I need to buy and set out to check items off of it. I was able to find some great deals and was able to cross a few people off of my list.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style=" margin-left: 40px;">
						All in all, it was a busy but rewarding day. I'm grateful for the ability to work from home and the flexibility it affords me. I was able to get a lot done and still have time for my hobbies and personal tasks.

						I had a busy day today at work (home-office workday). It was all about coming back to normal routines, setting it up on a technical level and mentally getting into it. "Mentally", meaning that I suffered from sleep-deprivation "jetlag" due to the lack of sleep from the nights in the hotel. I don't know, but I could just not get any sleep in that room I had. The AC sounded like a Combine harvester, the air was so dry that my throat and lips turned into a cardboard box and it kept me busy through out the whole night. I maybe dozed in a couple of times, but no real sleep.
					</p>
				
					<p class="main" >
						Apart from that, it was actually a great time. I missed the business travelling, the airport, the networking and that.. well, it's just a special time that keeps you on the edge and sharp most of the time. Then in the evening when you can relax and meet up with colleagues is really a nice counter weight to my normal working environment. The two extrems is needed for personal development, especially in my line of work!

						A little bit about the travelling, I flew from Brussels to Munich with Lufthansa. Together with SAS and KLM, Lufthansa is one of my favourite aviation companies. I also managed to hack the boarding system - I now figured out how they base the order of boarding. First off, everyone on the flight are divided up in groups. Group 1 and 2 all belong to business class and other prioritized customers. You just have to pay more for the tickets and you will be in these groups. Now comes the interesting part, groups 3 and 4 are based on the seats, but not by rows but by columns. People in group 3 are all who booked a window seat, which makes perfect sense not to be in the way for the group to board the aircraft. Namely seats located in the middle. Lastly, group 5, are people occupying the aisle seats. The order of boarding is especially important if you travel with carryon luggage and if the flight is full. Which is was in this case...I was lucky belonging to group 3 on both flights.
