						Yesterday was another workday in the Brussels office. It was a nice day seeing back colleagues - few that I still recognise, most of them are new. We discussed it and someone commented how many new hires there are. The oldies in the company hardly recognise anyone these days as most of them were hired during pandemic.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						After work I drove home (the traffic was terrible, completely stuck at times and it took almost 2 hours to get home) started charging the car only to leave again after about 45 minutes. J was going to meet up with friends and his parents went out to a restaurant to see friends. We have tried for so long to meet, but something always came in between. A pandemic, sickness and other unforeseen things that came in between. But finally, we could see them and it was really nice!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						This morning we slept in and could enjoy the coffee and breakfast in proper slow weekend pace. J had his guitar lesson while I took a nice walk between the rain showers, I could even enjoyed some sunshine. There was also time to start another 3D print, I am doing a re-print - the little box was such a success that we need at least one more.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Tonight we have our neighbour lady M over again for some board games and talks. A lot has happened on that front and we all need to be update each other. And to be comforted.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Tomorrow we are going for the day to the coast to meet up with friends. It will be nice to enjoy the seaside atmosphere, meet our friends and there is also a blues festival going on there. It will be late for sure...

						I finally got around to book a time for Covid-19 vaccination - the first slot that worked out for me is 26th of October.

						Today was another workday with a lot of calls, at least in the morning and then in the evening. In the late evening, I should say, since it was with colleagues in US, the west coast. Very nice team, it's very constructive and the work of setting up a great collaboration between Europe and US instances is going great.

Today is also a day when H normally can do home office - today was one of those days. Lately, it's not happening that frequent due to the extremely busy days. J was at the campus Antwerp south.

						It was an interesting day so far; up super early in the morning when realizing that I must be on the road driving to Brussels at least two hours before the appointment (to get my new passport and ID card. The very expensive one). How I have missed the traffic in the morning... <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-grin-tongue-wink fa-fw"></i>
					</p>
					
					<p class="main">
						Equipped with coffee and a nice Spotify playlist it was actually rather comfortable driving in the poring rain. After som searching, I found a parking spot not too far away from the consulate in good time. All went fine, friendly and pleasant people to deal with. Before I knew it I was back on the streets of Brussels again happy with my new Passport and international ID card. J, who came from school, and I were back home at the same time. As a bonus, I was even in perfect time for a conference call. Great!

						It's been a gray and rainy day today and a normal working day at work. I worked through some strategical admin stuff that's been put on hold for other priorities.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I managed to fiddle with my 3D printers some more today as well. So, that is always something I look forward to. Well, most of the times at least. It's not so funny when something like what happened yesterday happens. After about 2/3 into the 15 hours 3D print job, it stopped <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-sad-tear fa-fw"></i> !!! Not sure what happened, but it just stopped. Luckily, I can still use the unfinished object - the litterbox shuffle. 
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						One one hand, that made me take a decision to upgrade the firmware (both the firmware in the display and the machine) on the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.creality3dofficial.eu/products/ender-3-v2-3d-printer">Creality Ender 3 v2</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on the official site.</span></i> machine. Now I have Marlin version 1.0.7 (supporting the 4.2.2 board that is in the machine) and I am really happy the installation went smooth and painless.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I was also able to start a 3D print on my Prusa Mini+ 3D printer today. It's a small little modular box and it is still printing. I am really looking forward to check it out as it's a complete multi-use concept with multiple inlays and lids etc. I found it on <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.printables.com/model/243424-multi-use-case-with-inserts">Printables</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Have a look on this great product on Printables!</span></i>.

						Tomorrow will be an interesting day, I can finally go and get my passport and international ID card that I requested this summer when I was in Sweden. I have an appointment (yes, apparently it's now needed and the fee was increased to 19 EUR per document. Which means I have to pay 38 Euros additional to the 80 Euros I already paid in Sweden. What a rip off!) tomorrow morning in Brussels.

						The last two days have been great, just the opposite of the weather <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-grin-wink fa-fw"></i>. Like always, the coffee was great this morning. As far as I can remember... We have also done some home improvements in our hallway. I am too tired to post any pictures of it right now, but it will come. Our neighbour lady D. just went home after a nice evening with dinner and some board games again. It's really a hit...
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Another thing; J. started up again with his first guitar lesson of the season.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I can hopefully remember to start a 15+ hours 3D print first thing in the morning tomorrow. It's really interesting because I am planning to do 3D print one of my very first prints that I ever designed. I have re-sliced it and saved the new g-code file earlier today. I am really curious to see how it turns out since I used something that was not available when I first created it.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Oh, we also managed to do some work on our publication that we're doing for our neighbour ladies as a surprise. Something that lady D. can enjoy to read about what's going on at home.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						A small annoyance found, I noticed that the previous <i>did you know</i> posts where all from August instead of September... for instance; the post I made two days ago is not related to 22nd of September, but 22nd of August. Anyway, it's now been corrected.

						Today, another special day full of surprises and new experiences - all positives in the newt step of our lives. Today was a day full of calls and interesting things happening on a professional level. I didn't have much time at all during my break which was a pity as the weather was very nice today. I could however go out and do a 20 minutes walk in the garden (of which I cleaned up a crazy amount of Acorns...).
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J spent the day at home today, he had online lessons for the first time. Again, something new to get used to. Even though we have had some experience before of that for years, this is something completely new. It's so well arranged and professionally done. The only slight similarity is the location. But that is where all comparisons ends.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I didn't have time to do any of 3D printing or Raspberry Pi related stuff. I did however take some time for our secret little project - something called the <i>P&P Publication</i>. Something we're doing for our dear neighbour lady D. who's in the hospital for the moment. But more about that soon...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I decided that I just don't have time to drive to Brussels tomorrow. I just have too many calls and things to do. I ended the day with a very constructive call with our colleagues in US. Such a nice team to work with, quite different from how we work in Europe. If I am lucky another trip to LA for me can be arranged. Remember, I have a new fresh passport waiting for me in the Swedish consulate in Brussels...

						It turned out to be a good day after all. We went through some strange things. It was strike where I live, the union attached to the public transportation (trams and buses) were on strike. Is there something that I hate is the idea of strikes <i style="font-size: 20px; color: darkred;" class="far fa-angry fa-fw"></i>. It's the first sign that the country is on the verge of being an under-developed country. 
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J. is traveling with the tram to school every day and it was especially important today. But, due to the strike, that was not possible today. As he couldn't risk being late or miss classes this morning was the best solution to drive him to the campus. Luckily, I could take the scheduled call in the car!  
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I did a 3D print today for my friend and colleague D. It's actually a re-print of something that he liked so much that he wanted more of it, it's a tripod mount for a Sony video action camera. I'll just give it a coat of epoxy paint and it's done.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Today ended with having our dear neighbour lady M over for dinner. 2nd week of the treatment is well on the way for her partner and it's tough for both of them to cope, so we're trying to help out as much as we can. It was a nice evening and J joined in and could tell stories about his first days as a student at university. Now, we are all tired and it's time for bed.

						Another early morning and a day learning the new routines for all of us. I enjoyed my coffee, had to brew a new pot already at 09:00 o'clock. OK I admit, it had a little bit to do to the fact that our dear cleaning lady A. was here today (she like coffee and a snack during her break).

						I was writing about the "everyday micro holidays" yesterday. Today, in the same genre, I thought about quality of life (without going to the "Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance" level) and concluded that it's if you're able to add some luxury to the little "ordinary everyday" things in life that makes the difference. An example is to be able to enjoy the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.catharinadal.be/onze-kazen/blauwschimmelkazen/grevenbroecker">best cheese in the world</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">"Achelse blauwe" is the best blue cheese that I know.

						EARLY up and about for all of us today. We discovered late last night that J had to be on another campus than what was initially said. So, plans changed a couple of times 	before it matched with the plans for everyone involved. and finally, just before going to bed, we had the strategy clear for us. The term "morning routine" was almost forgotten, it ended more than 3 months ago and now it's back, but totally on another level. The biggest difference is that we are now three grown-ups discussing it on the same level...if you know what I mean.
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						Anyways, it's a big change. One thing I am sure of though, is that it couldn't start any better!

It will be a VERY early for some of us in the family who will have to take the tram early in the morning to go to the university in Antwerp.

						J is with friends tonight to support a friend, let's call her <i>friend N.</i>. A friend who actually is in a huge TV production (the biggest DJ in Belgium) that's searching for the next big star. It will not be too late and no alcohol involved as he is with his moped. It's a nice group of friends who's there supporting one of them.

						Today was an ordinary work day, a lot of important stuff happened and I have to take some important decisions in some of the projects...but that is to be expected. Expect the unforeseen. And that is exactly the charm of my job, one day is never the other alike.

						Today we welcome our dear neighbour lady M who is going through the most difficult times of her life. Her life partner, her friend, her soul mate is currently sick and need some treatment (no need to explain the seriousness, it will be fine) for some time. The process has started and it will be going on for weeks to follow. Some key weeks to follow.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J has a welcome day at the university tomorrow. Right after a dr's appointment that he needs to do. They suggest youth to vaccinate against a certain HPV virus. As far as I understand, it's a sexual transmitted virus and something that used to be suggested for girls, but now apparently also for boys. So, if it helps, why not? 3 separate jabs are needed for the complete treatment.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Anyway, tomorrow I will bring J to the university to first get all the books (all 14 of them) which I will take back home. J will then have to go to another campus to attend the welcome session and from there come back home.

						The work week started in all its glory and I am glad I could finally turn off the worklaptop at around 18:30. Especially since it was a grewsome start this morning. The Grewsome word is a strong word, but once a month we have an "executive update" and you always have to be on your "best behaviour" and well prepared. You know what I am talking about and we all have it. Anyway, if that happens on a Monday morning it is a struggle. At least for me. So, thus, that is why I am glad the day is over and I can enjoy the evening...

						It was a nice and joyful day today. It was needed especially after the turmoil (an unspoken reaction from a family member. No matter age or situation, people can not show that level disrespect to others) yesterday, the family gathering turned out completely different from what we thought. I guess that is what to expect at times with family. Unfortunately even family members have different level of class, moral and capacity. Anyway, it proves my general motto - people are shit, do not waste energy on people who's not worth it, save it for the ones who appreciate it!
