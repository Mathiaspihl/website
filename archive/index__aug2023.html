						The last day of August (still 58 minutes left of it) was a good day. I can not complain if everyone that you know survived the day without too much of drama or receiving any bad news. It was also a manageable day at work with a nice ending - a nice call with my a few of my good colleagues in US. I can not forget to send details of some interesting places in Belgium (will be easy as they are interested in beer and the history of 2nd world war) as one colleague will travel to France and Belgium during her holiday. 
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J's girlfriend K left for the airport to travel to Italy today. We already received the first update from her location; looks really nice! J. had some time to practice on his upcoming performance - he will play guitar <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar fa-xl" style="color: #125dde;"></i> at a party in the weekend - and played from his playlist for his biggest fans. His parents thus. It sounds fantastic, I must say. I actually recorded parts of it and will try to find a way of sharing it here with you soon. I think I need to edit it (removing the sounds from over excited parents in the background etc) a bit before though.
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						OK, now I am off to bed. It will be an early morning tomorrow again...

						It's been a couple of days again, but it's not been too much to handle at work. A lot but manageable. For H. it is all starting up and there is a lot's been going on there for weeks. For me I have been already been working some time and I am trying to connect back to my hobbies - some of them at least. We have also been busy with J's last exams - guidance and coordination and upcoming travels. Interesting how difficult it is to get Dirham (currency of Morocco), insurance (something girlfriend K first highlighted) and ...well, just being parents having a son going to an "underdeveloped country where they all want to kill you". That is how it feels at least. Overprotective? Who can blame me in the current situation that we're in...
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Puhhhh, anyways. Girlfriend K. travels first (leaving tomorrow from us) to Italy and J. will meet her in Milano a week later and from there they will continue to Marrakesh after a couple of days. One day I also want to see Marrakesh, but it is absolutely not a priority. There are so many cultures that inspires me and give something back that I prefer to invest my time in. 
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						For the rest, I can inform you that I have been able to do some 3D printing again. Oh, I continued the filament spool holders and then I found something new; I found a great <i class="tooltipimg">screwdriver holder <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/19/78/3elWZHrv_o.jpg">Check this out, a fantastic 3D print.

						Today was a very Sunday-like Sunday - slow and relaxed. For us it feels like the summer is really over and we are heading into another period of work- private life rhythm. Another chapter is around the corner about to start... J is studying for his last exams for this term, then he'll be traveling with his girlfriend to Marrakech <i class="fa-solid fa-mosque fa-xl"></i> - with an extended stopover in Milan, Italy.

Once I made the decision to change to <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.emclient.com/?lang=en">eM Client</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about eM Client here.

					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Last night there was lightning and thunder with heavy rain. It culminated just when J was taking the tram from Antwerp to go home. He missed one tram, the other was cancelled so it got late last night. We were not in bed before 01 am o'clock. The late night together with the dark and grey morning were reasons why we overslept this morning. I am so ready for the weekend!

						I am always interested in finding the best application in a specific area. Take for instance email client applications... Recently it's been again the time for checking out email clients and as always, I have something for Thunderbird. But every time it lets me down on the performance - the alert message <i class="tooltipimg">"not responding" <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/b8/77/2VHIpqdh_o.png">The exception message popping up far too often!</span></i> comes up too often. When the development halted some time back I left it alone for a while and then all of a sudden Mozilla stepped in and the community and interest started again. I was one of them. This time I really tried to understand the reasons behind the issues. I read a lot of articles, watch videos and really gave it a second chance. I think I am starting to figure how it all hangs together. How the IMAP protocol works opposed to POP, server- and client side refresh and so much more. Very interesting indeed! This time I will give it some more time...

						It feels great with the weekend starting now. Friday, yes! Workwise, was it not too bad today. I could focus on my planned action items and some admin tasks. Yesterday however, was really heavy, I had no time with anything except attending calls and writing the minutes (to remember what we agreed on etc) from them.

						J had his last exam today - MS Excel - for this week. Next week there are two more ...both in one and the same day. I picked him up earlier today and I saw at once how tired he was. He's just exhausted after the week of studying and everything he is busy with. I remember, as soon as you have a serious relationship it all changes. Especially for a guy! But it was such a treat having him in the car talking about how nice it was meeting up with his friend (his very best friend G.) and to be able to just being boys together.

						I am trying to get Brevo (or MailJet) working. I followed all possible setups, guides, tips and tricks. I have even been in contact with the support and I have a support case that has been raised to the technical team. It seems it's something REALLY complicated. There are two main issues; one is being able to use the SMTP service, just to send emails (at the time of writing this post, it's been resolved. I have a very positive experience with Brevo support). I have a little Python program that checks if a webpage was updated. If that's the case it will send an email with the details. 
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						The other open issue is getting my domain (<i>mathiaspihl.com</i>) authenticated. For what ever reason I am not able to validate it with the DNS records that I have to enter at my domain registrar Namecheap.com. I even raised a separate support case with them as well... The goal is to be able to send email with the domain accordingly.

						There were a couple of days - 3 to be specific - since I last wrote here. Today we have a day off where I live. A lot of the European countries on the continent are doing the same thing.

						At least I had the day off today. It was great of course It is, however, ONE day off and a lot to do. J studied for 2 exams tomorrow - accounting and French. Then the plan was for him to re-allocate to Antwerp in the evening where he'd meet up with K. in the evening. His parents - us thus - casually "hanging around" as we pretended to have nothing else to do, to support him where we could. The plan was to act as if it WAS planned thus. Much like his studding for Excel a day earlier. I think our masterplan worked.

						Unfortunately there are some worrying news from the next door ladies. We did not yet get any conclusive, but it is always worrying receiving unforeseen changes and that she has to go into the hospital for further investigations <i class="fa-regular fa-face-frown fa-xl"></i>. It might be a minor complication, but there is this little risk that it's something worse. That is the biggest shit with cancer...

						I have worked more on getting the workflow of updating this site standardized - aligning the process in Ubuntu OS (Raspberry Pi). I have missed specific shortcuts that runs a few macros (<i class="tooltip"><a href="/index_bookmarks.html#vscode">VS code extension</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about my best VS Code extensions here.</span></i>) I have made to speed up repetitive tasks etc. I installed the extension and created the macros and mapped the shortcuts accordingly. It is working perfectly. I am now perfectly aligned when it comes to the workflow on Windows, iOS (Mac) and Linux (Ubuntu Mate/Raspberry Pi). Github (Github Desktop or Git Cola) and VS Code is working exactly the same no matter on what I am working with.

						It was a relaxed morning, it is hard to beat the feeling of a relaxed weekend breakfast with great coffee. Today J is studying for the exams (K travelled back to her parents yesterday evening) and we are doing some relaxed chores around the house.

						We have started looking through all the images taken during our holiday - the travels to Sweden and then also to Greece. Didn't know we had take well over 1500 pictures... The goal is making photo albums out of them. It will surely be a huge task.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I re-discovered three pictures and the memories came back of one moment in Sweden. I believe I mentioned that we passed by my childhood house, the very first one we lived in. I mentioned about it to my mom when we spoke earlier today, so I decided to attach them to an email and update them all about that specific moment as it's a rather cool story, in short; the son of the person who bough the house from us now lives there with his family. It was also so cool that I could show my son the place I grew up in, <i class="tooltipimg">the house <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/a3/15/Wnr467PD_o.jpg">My childhood house where we first lived, where I spent my first 10 years.</span></i> my dad built and registered 1973.

						The trip back from Greece went extremely smooth, everything including packing and leaving the house in Greece, returning the rental car, taking the flight back and getting the car out of the long-term parking in Amsterdam airport and driving back home. We even could perfectly time it to also pick up J's girlfriend K who was waiting for us with home cooked dinner (so sweet) at the tram station.

					<p class="main">
						The routine changed dramatically and started for all of us suddenly today, J with his studying for the exams, H with all the preparation and daily work and I jumped back into the daily work. I must say that it all went great for all of us. Important is to be able to keep the balance and the focus, but not get lost in the daily work too much. We just have to remind our self's about the fantastic time we had and what really is important in life.
