						Had a fantastic breakfast this morning, this day off - I bridged the day as it's a bank holiday tomorrow. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The main activity planned for today is to guide J in his studying - an Excel exam is coming up soon. All the theory is done and the plan was to do some practical exercises in the afternoon. We started, but got interrupted as he needed to attend an online meeting. Hopefully, when we resume again, it will go a little bit smoother... <i style="font-size: 20px;color: darkred;" class="far fa-grimace fa-fw"></i>

There are more places and use cases at home - bathroom, laundry room etc - if it proves to be a good product. Seems promising; already after about an hour I could see some fluid collected in the tank. The daily limit for this - the smallest model in this range - is 250 ml.

						Woke up this morning feeling much better. I slept like a baby (except for a short intermezzo at 02:00 when J arrived home) and also had an "extra hour" more to enjoy this morning. Fantastic coffee with the breakfast. We could even enjoy some sun and a quick stroll in the garden and watering the plants before H had to leave for Brussels.

She is visiting J's godmother S. in Brussels today. Hopefully they can enjoy the day with nice weather.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						While driving back from the train station, Google led me through some really nice areas in Berchem. It could probably be classified as an alternative-artistic-upper-class neighbourhood. The Tesslas are parked in front of the carefully arranged townhouse-entries to have that "nonchalant" overgrown look (the gardeners have made a superb job) <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-smile-wink fa-fw"></i>. But it was very pretty driving through the streets in the sun!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Today will be the focus to help out J with some schoolwork - it's a study week coming up for the first upcoming exams. Let's see if I can squeeze in some 3D design/-printing in between. I would also need to backup my Raspberry Pi's...

						Enjoying my coffee  tremendously this gray Sunday morning. The plan was to go to Brussels, but we learned that there is a huge demonstration for the environment today in Brussels between 13:00 and 20:00. The message is basically "if you don't have to, do not come to Brussels with car today".

						Today was an active day so far, still done in a relaxed way but there was always something going on. After a nice and relaxed breakfast, it was time to do some work in the garden. It was a nice sunny day which made it even more pleasant. Then J went to the guitar lesson while the rest of the family headed out to the closest shopping mall - a small one in the neighbourhood - to buy some jeans.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J showed some interest in old cameras, the old cameras that you have to load a roll of film and have it developed <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fa-solid fa-camera-retro"></i>. SO cute how he was asking where the preview was. Took some convincing him on how it works, explaining him that there are only 24 or 36 pictures in one roll. Also talked about how the ISO number is the light sensitivity of the film, the logic of the shutter speed and the aperture. It was a lot to take in, for sure. He is very impressed about the 3 old cameras that I still have - the Pentax S3, the Leica R4 MOT Electric and a Cannon 400 (I also have the digital one) and all the equipment that goes with it. Trip down the memory lane for sure. It was actually one undeveloped roll of film still in the Leica camera... I have to get it developed!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I am also busy doing some research on solarpanel installation - the loans and local legislations, companies and providers, whether it's wise to also include a battery, the return of investment, ...etc. It's actually very interesting! More to come for sure!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I also found some interesting X- and Z linear rails that would fit and be the next little upgrade project for my Creality 3D printer. I am really excited about that actually, moving away from the wheels and use linear rails instead.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow we will go to Brussels and meet up with J's Swedish Godmother S. who has been living in Brussels for a long time and works for the EU parliament.

						I almost forgot to mention another interesting thing, at least for me, is that Amazon now is present in Belgium. Yes, we are a bit after the rest of the developed countries. Before I had to order from Amazon in Germany or in the Netherlands. What made it all more interesting was the great deal to hook up with Amazon Prime services (which means Amazon streaming and next-day delivery service in shipping etc). It was such a great price that I simply could NOT resist. I simply had to try it out and I ordered something (see previous post) <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-grin-wink fa-fw"></i>.

						J and I had the evening mostly for our self's, I did the cooking (curry madrass with basmati rice was on the menu). One of those cook at home kits that you buy a la HelloFresh.

						It's silly that I didn't update earlier than now. Well, it means then that I have been preoccupied with other stuff. True, to some extend. There is always time for updating here for me as it is something I like to do, easy for me and the process of doing it is, or so I thought, streamlined. It got me thinking and I have been investigating the "static webpage generation" framework called Hugo. Hugo is something that I have known for a long time (started when checking the best framework for <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.jmajhemela.eu">JmaJhemela</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The website for the music school I made.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Anyways, so where do I start? Pathetic as I am only talking about 2 days but it feels like a week. I did some printing today, some Halloween decoration stuff that can be cool to have.

						Away from it all, I am so in balance at the moment. That is what we have to be happy for, the micro-moments when we feel the bliss.

						Just before that happened, there are things/crises at work. When your boss calls and wonder about something and we have to clear out a missunderstanding my stress level was already elevated.

						Today was a great day. But it did not start and certainly did not progress according to plans. Not at all, it completely changed! The guitar teacher was sick and the lesson cancelled, neighbour lady D will not come home today and tomorrow the plans of visiting J's god mom S in Brussels is not going through due to sickness. It completely changes the weekend from a weekend full of things planned to something that I can really appreciate! It's almost like we get a whole weekend for our self's free to do what ever we want. As a bonus. You know what I mean, right..? 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Yesterday we visited parents in law with the family of my brother in law. It was just a gettogether without a special reason, just because we can, no pandemic, no restrictions and because it was a long time since we did it. It was nice and cosy, J passed by also to say hi before he headed out with friends. They had planned a HP - an House Party. It was apparently fantastic! He arrived home safe and sound at around 03:00. We saw the pictures today from parents and also from J - what a fantastic bunch of friends!!!

						Neighbour lady D just left an evening with board games and nice food. Actually, it was great food - home made burgers made by a well renowned burger cook. Yes you guessed it, I made them <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-grin-tongue-wink fa-fw"></i>.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, I have to wait with the update about the latest development in the world of 3D printing and recent 3D development on home front. I spent so much time to finalize it today - I ran into some unforeseen issues. I was so excited when I could finally resolved the issues I struggled with... I know you can't wait to hear about it, but you just have to collect all your patience until tomorrow <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-smile-wink fa-fw"></i>... I have to go to bed.

						Yesterday ended a fantastic weekend really with a climax - the visit to the seaside. We had a nice time with our friends at their caravan (it's more like a little house), had a cosy time together with nice drinks and snacks. Then a walk along the seaside to the restaurant to eat and enjoy a blues-band that was playing the whole night. The music and the food was absolutely brilliant!

						Yesterday was another workday in the Brussels office. It was a nice day seeing back colleagues - few that I still recognise, most of them are new. We discussed it and someone commented how many new hires there are. The oldies in the company hardly recognise anyone these days as most of them were hired during pandemic.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						After work I drove home (the traffic was terrible, completely stuck at times and it took almost 2 hours to get home) started charging the car only to leave again after about 45 minutes. J was going to meet up with friends and his parents went out to a restaurant to see friends. We have tried for so long to meet, but something always came in between. A pandemic, sickness and other unforeseen things that came in between. But finally, we could see them and it was really nice!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						This morning we slept in and could enjoy the coffee and breakfast in proper slow weekend pace. J had his guitar lesson while I took a nice walk between the rain showers, I could even enjoyed some sunshine. There was also time to start another 3D print, I am doing a re-print - the little box was such a success that we need at least one more.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Tonight we have our neighbour lady M over again for some board games and talks. A lot has happened on that front and we all need to be update each other. And to be comforted.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Tomorrow we are going for the day to the coast to meet up with friends. It will be nice to enjoy the seaside atmosphere, meet our friends and there is also a blues festival going on there. It will be late for sure...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I finally got around to book a time for Covid-19 vaccination - the first slot that worked out for me is 26th of October.
