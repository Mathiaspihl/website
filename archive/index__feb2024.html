						It was a leap year this year, thus February was one day longer. We have to wait another 4 years until next time. Then I will be 55 years old. How weird that sounds. Will I still post stories here then..?

						One of the chores on my list was to finally fix the pump in the pond, now and then it stops (most of the times it is simply clogged and it turns off automatically as a safety feature). While I was cleaning it, I notice that the hose between the pump to the filter (3 chamber filter) it cracks almost straight through. The first thought is that I have to turn it off until I buy a new 38 mm in diameter and 5 m long spiral reinforced pond hose. Then I started to analyse how I could fix it. As a temporary solution I decided to do as professionals - loads of Duct Tape. I found two types of Duct Tape and made sure <span class="tooltipimg">to use enough&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/2b/0e/JNz6DCdu_o.jpg" alt="pond reinforced spiral pond hose">It's working great, at least as a temporary fix! You can see that I have two types of Duct tape, the traditional silver coloured one and then I also used a black one. I am such a DIY guy ;-)</span></span> and it proved to work fine. At least until I have a new one. I checked the price online to get an idea of the price before I went to the local hardware store. Lucky that I did, the price is exactly double in the store, 50 EUR for a piece of hose!? I left it in the store (I do support local business, but I am not stupid) and went home to order it online (I also bought other stuff for the pond in preparation for the seasonal starting up).

						Today was a memorable day, it was the day when our solar panel provider company finally turned up. They have managed to get all the teams (well, all the two of them) aligned and agreed to actually be here. It was a complicated task, they actually had to get up ON our roof and check if the additional weights were placed there during installation (they informed us that it looks like they are <i>definitely</i> not there). The car was moved from the driveway, all the neighbours were informed (for the 3rd time) and we all were anxiously waited the result as they bravely rose to the occasion and took the task of exploring the uncharted territory and... Yes, our heroes <i class="fa-solid fa-user-secret fa-xl"></i> found that the additional weights are already there. Mission accomplished and all are happy...

						Another workweek to look forward to and by the end of it we are already in March. It is just craziness that February 2024 is almost done. Anyway, we can only <i>fasten the seat-belt</i> and enjoy the ride. What do we have to look forward to this week? I ordered coffee <i class="fa-solid fa-mug-hot fa-xl"></i> that will be delivered today. Also today we will finally know how Hungary votes <i class="fa-regular fa-handshake fa-xl"></i> for Swedish NATO membership (much like Turkey, Hungary is delaying the process for own benefit, delayed by greed). Tomorrow is a super busy workday, seems a lot of the meetings were condensed to that day. Our cleaning lady A. will also be here. Wednesday will be an interesting day as well. Hopefully, third time lucky, the solar panel <i class="fa-solid fa-solar-panel fa-xl" style="color: #1a231b;"></i> provider company will be here to install the added fixation weights.

						What happened since last post? Last Friday we had our neighbour ladies over for a super nice dinner. The youth was also with us for a while before a birthday party they had to be at. It was nice to have them with us. On Saturday we had great plans together with J's girlfriend K. It was time for the planned surprise party that we'd been planning for so long and finally the day had come. It was a total and an utterly surprise for J who suspected nothing, completely oblivious to all the secret activities we had done for the last weeks. Everyone who was invited turned up on time and all the arrangements went as good as we hoped for, all the decorations (after ski theme, with fake snow, firepit etc) everything were just perfect. It was a lot of work - before and during - but so worth it when Sunday was there that we just enjoyed the memories we created and that we were a part of. <i class="fa-regular fa-heart fa-beat fa-xl" style="color: #e60000;"></i>

						OK, today is today (that's a weird start) and this post is only about today. But reflecting back of course. With the perspective of today...thus. Alright then, here we go...
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I do not think that I mentioned the most upsetting thing happening on a personal level this week. So far, at least. Yesterday we were supposed to have the solar panel guys over again. Yes indeed it was the second try around. Last time they "forgot about it" and they felt so bad about it. This time we made sure to do the same thing again and have it all sorted out - informing neighbours, strategically blocking the street with our cars upfront if they would need space with the mobile crane...and being ready at 07:00 in the morning. At 09:30 still nothing! Not even an SMS... I was furious. H. did her magic and talked with all parties involved, she even did the work of the internal communication in their company. Absolutely unbelievable...(a rant about us being the customer paying for a certain minimum service and quality), to say the least! Anyways... Apparently one of the guys had been in an accident and could not come. To make a long and very painful story short, they will try the third time next Wednesday. We will see how it plays out...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						...oh well. I have to calm myself down. Try to, at least. It will be difficult in the weather we are having here at the moment. They are forecasting storm and I really do not like that...

						It feels like the weekend just started and <i>all of a sudden</i> here I am sitting contemplating about everything and nothing on a Sunday afternoon (even if it turned into afternoon only 10 minutes ago, but still).

I have been putting it off for a while because I thought it would be a tedious job, first to unload the freezer then unscrewing the mounts holding the flaps in place... But today I took the time to investigate the matter. I started searching internet for someone who's been through the same issue (and preferably documented how it's done in a Youtube clip). Surely I am not the only one, I thought. To my excitement I only found one video clip, namely <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://youtu.be/B-v0x6N6qko?si=f2Jo2zuQt7i_e7vs">this one</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-video fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This was exactly what I was searching for!

Much like me, it is clear that he has his freezer also in his garage... I followed the instructions and 15 minutes later I had replaced both flaps. Extremely satisfying!

						Talking about frustrations, on Tuesday we had booked an appointment with the solar panels provider to add additional weights to them (to prevent that they end up at the neighbours during a storm...) Now, do you think they showed up? No, they never showed up and had apparently forgotten to plan for all the teams. Extremely disappointing! Especially if you also take into consideration that they forgot the "extra weights" during installation. People are getting fired for less...

						OK, so last update was last Friday before a fully planned weekend - after a typical crazy workday Monday - and now it all seems so long ago. It was such a perfect city trip together with our loved son J. and his girlfriend K. We spent such a cosy, fun and interesting weekend together. I can keep on going like that, but it's a fact (and I have the pictures to prove it at older age)!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I did not have too much time over for anything more than work, it was an unusual Monday (normally I try to schedule Monday's for "admin work" with no meetings) with a lot of scheduled calls. Never the less, in between we are connecting fine during the school holiday that we have here this week. Actually, just a week of school holiday is simply an overkill to me!  
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						J. and K. went back this afternoon to Antwerp for a couple of days for studying, a triple-date and well, just their own life. We have enjoyed the evening with...well, our life. Our life living in parallel with him, is how I should see it. To enjoy (and cherish every moments when it comes together) from the side lines. I will fall asleep with a content feeling tonight!

I am sure they are enjoying life a little bit extra, both of them received their results from their past exams and they have passed everything!

						Yesterday we really enjoyed a dinner with our neighbour ladies. We ordered out from our favourite Asian restaurant, talked, laughed and played a dice game (called "keer op keer"). And laughed some more. It was just a fantastic time...

						It was a crazy week for the rest. The TV installation is working, the solar panels are also OK and then we had a strange power outage. A long story short; the electrician had to pass by and it was discovered that one damaged connection was the issue causing an isolated power outage in the bedroom and my office (obviously an critical issue for my work). It is just madness how it all happened the same day (have I ever said that before?) when both our cleaning woman A and the window washer Y are here, I also received a lot of deliveries and some of my calls I had to use my cellular phone... just to mention a few things that went on. Oh and yes, we had to replace our TV decoder as well during this ordeal...Anyway, all ended good.

						January is history and we entered February of 2024. A lot happened the last days, it was really like a lot of stuff were squeezed in and scheduled to happen in the first month of 2024. I tell you right away...
