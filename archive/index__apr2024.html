						It is a beautiful day today, the sun is shining, blue skies and not a lot of wind. If I have time, I'll try to enjoy it and have a break in the garden. I might be able to have my lunch there.

						A couple of days ago, I think it was Sunday night, I watched a Youtube clip about someone showing a new AI coding completion and chat service called&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://codeium.com/autocomplete">Codeium</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">Read more about it here on their homepage.</span></i>. I saw the plug-in for Visual Code in action and it almost seemed too good to be true. It is also completely free. Other AI plug-ins - like Copilot etc - are always linked with your ChatGPT account which will at some point generate a cost. But this one is completely free and lightning fast with an amazingly good result. I installed it and&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">tried it out&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/b3/e2/25eW3wP9_o.png" alt="codeium vscode">Here it is in action. Installing the VSCode extension was smooth and I was up and running in a couple of minutes. It worked great!</span></span> by creating a Bootstrap page from scratch. I then went into it and used Codeium to update and add features to the page. Fantastic results, simply amazing!

						For the observant one, I made some small updates on the site. Well, it is a mix, small typos and spelling mistakes here and there. But I also changed the generic format of tooltips - it used to look like this&nbsp;<i class="tooltip"><a>BEFORE</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The old format!</span></i> and now it is like&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a>THIS</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">...and this is how it looks now, much cleaner. You will especially notice it in the Bookmarks page.</span></i>. It applies on all items showing tooltips (more than you think). All except the pop-up images, I thought it looked best the old way. I am also introducing a new section, but more about that soon...<i class="fa-solid fa-user-secret fa-xl" style="color: #02173b;"></i>

						A whole work-week has already gone by, yet another interesting week behind us. First and foremost were there a lot of development in projects at work. I can not disclose the details here, but it has been everything from turbulence to positive feedback, to word it diplomatically. I am happy that I still enjoy what I am doing, in an ever changing environment and I still feel very much appreciated at my position. 
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Some other things that happened in the week of less work related type; we had an appointment with someone from the company that built our kitchen about some 20 years ago. We want to have the cupboard- and drawer doors replaced and some general maintenance. He came by, we talked about what we want and some pictures were taken and then he left. I think it took at most 15 minutes. It will be interesting see what he proposes (and what the costs are). We also were contacted by the internet service provider to let us know that a technician was booked - to complete the fibre connection installation - on the 8th of May.

					<p class="main">
						My son J. and his girlfriend K. were helping out - in charge of the alcohol free bar<i class="fa-solid fa-martini-glass fa-beat fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #5c5c5c;"></i>and DJ - at J's cousin's 16's birthday party yesterday.

						The busy weekend is almost at it's end, the evening is here and we are enjoying the last hours cosy at home. It was indeed a busy weekend, but we enjoyed every moment. We spent a great time with our friends A. and P. at their house in the Netherlands (in the municipal of Utrecht). Today we were invited to a birthday party in the restaurant called&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.denboomgaardmeise.be/">Den Boomgaard</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">The food and service was really good!</span></i>&nbsp;in Meise. After the lunch (an extended one to say the least) we drove back and picked up J. from the train station before we arrived home.
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						In the talks with our friends A. and P. they pointed out difficult it is to find any historical books/information (excluding the option of searching the internet) about the history of Sweden. But I honestly think we would have the same issue finding out the history of The Netherlands in Sweden. I recalled seeing that there is a documentary about the Swedish history - fittingly named <i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29553855">"The History of Sweden"</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">I have not yet seen it, but it seems to be a great documentary about the Swedish history - from the very beginning up until today.</span></i> - on the streaming service SVTPlay.se. I haven't see it yet, but now I want to start binge watching all the 10 episodes to learn more about the Swedish History. I hope I can share it with my Dutch friends (I have translated my own Dutch subtitles for all episodes so that they can follow along).
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, I think it is all the writing I have the energy for today.

						Here we go, the week started out pretty normal, on Wednesday I drove J. to the apartment in Antwerp. OK, that is something not extraordinary. But a couple of minutes into the drive the car started giving strange warning messages. It started by warning about the tire pressure was too low, That the TPMS needed service. Then I discovered that the outside temperature supposedly was -45 centigrade. It's cold here, but I can assure you that it's not THAT cold. All the way into Antwerp I was checking the status, I also stopped at one time to physically check the tires. Nothing wrong with them<i class="fa-solid fa-face-angry fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #d40202;"></i>. Anyway, I made my way there, dropped J. off and then drove back. As I was getting closer to home it started normalize, the tire pressure warning stopped and the temperature was also slowly getting normalized.

						Yesterday it was planned that we finally would have fibre connection installed. If you read my earlier post about it, I was very doubtful that it would actually happen. I was right. Well, it's partly done. The fibre cable from the street outside into our garage is completed. Now at least we have a new&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">little box&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/34/58/jumIpsBS_o.jpg" alt="internet fibre box">This is what we got installed, the orange fibre cable leading into the <i>little box</i>.</span></span>&nbsp;installed in the garage.

						The upcoming week is busy, J. just left for a wedding party (someone in girlfriend K's family is getting married) and returns on Sunday. Tomorrow we will drive to The Netherlands visiting our friends P. and A.. Then on Sunday we have a family party to go to...

						The last couple of days flew by, I was surprised to see that I have not written anything since before the weekend! The weekend passed by, we finalized some huge home projects and chores - getting the garden ready for summer, going through and sorting out all the kitchen cupboards. Huge undertakings! The result was however fantastic! 
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The youths - J and K thus - arrived back from Morocco safe and sound on Monday evening. We went and got them in Eindhoven without any major issues. It was absolutely great to see them back again. A lot of thoughts and memories came back, for one; how it must have felt for my parents when I returned from trips. J. is back from Antwerp after his first lessons of the semester and soon we'll have dinner. We have not been able to connect as a family since the trip to France (feels like an eternity ago).
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Finally fibre. On Thursday we have an appointment with our dear ISP company (the Internet Service Provider, but also Telecom and TV provider as well) to come over to finally install the fibre connection<i class="fa-solid fa-award fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #fba82b;"></i>. I have the feeling that it is too good to be true, I'd be surprised if they just arrive, do their work and that I actually have a working fibre connection working on Thursday. But let us see, hope is the last thing that leaves us.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						During sorting out the kitchen cupboards etc, I received a request to 3D print<img class="img-myicons" src="/images/3d-printer.svg" width="30px">. I love those kind of requests. Basically we need some tailor-made cutlery inlays in the drawers. Early on I thought that it's a perfect project to develop in&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://openscad.org/">Open SCAD</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">It really grows on me, I love Open SCAD.</span></i> - the parameterized CAD system to create 3D solid objects.

						The week started, a pretty ordinary work week I'd say. Of course, it's never fun coming back from after holidays, but it was OK without too much drama. A lot of coffee and adjusting to the new schedule again. "Same old, same old", one could say.
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						On a private note however, it is another story. The youths are in Marrakesh as I mentioned earlier and that is not running as smooth as one could hope for... I wrote in the previous post about how they discovered that they had no hotel when they arrived. We managed to arrange for a new hotel for the first days then another hotel had to be arranged. After a lot of patience and difficulties in communicating with all parties involved, it was finally settled on Wednesday noon. The youths had an arranged excursion that day and then the idea was to return to the old hotel and from there, with their luggage, go to the new one. Don't you think that same thing happened, the hotel did not exist. There was no hotel with the given address... Imagine "the deja vu" feeling that dwelled up again. For all of us! After some moments of stress and heated feelings, they found the hotel, which apparently had changed name and location without anyone knowing about it upfront. All good, and when they finally found it, all was great again. The hotel is apparently superb!

						Today was an exceptionally long day. Yes, it started already at 03:30 when the alarm clock went off. At 04:00 we - the youths as well - were all sitting in the car heading for the airport in Eindhoven. I hardly slept at all during the already short night. And I can surely relate to how it must feel for the Zombies... <i class="fa-regular fa-face-dizzy fa-xl"></i>
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						At least the youths were set off in perfect time, the were safely boarding in time all was good. Until they arrived at the hotel in Marrakesh... The hotel was no more. They were informed that it's been closed for months and there they where. Alone on the street in Marrakesh. <i class="fa-regular fa-face-surprise fa-shake fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #e60f00;"></i> Luckily they have booked it via a legit booking agency (Booking.com) which means that they have some sort of service included. Trying to reach the hotel was hopeless, the best bet was with Booking.com, which I suggested. Since it is extremely expensive (and not easily done on the streets of Marrakesh) using their mobile phones, the coordination and communication went to us. Which we happily did. To shorten a VERY long story, we managed to sort everything out thanks to the diplomatic skills of H. and a helpful support guy at <i>Booking.com</i>. So for now our little ones have a safe place to stay until Wednesday. Then we have to hunt for a hotel stay until they leave on Monday... The charm of being a parent!

Furthermore, I introduced some new enhancements and new thinking in the 3D printed frames. But now, time for bed...
