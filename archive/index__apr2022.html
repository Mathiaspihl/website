						I am back... feels like it was ages that I last wrote here. So much is going on, crazy much for everyone but the most annoying is that J is not feeling 100%. Like most of his friends.

						The dinner yesterday - celebrating the good news about neighbour lady D - was brilliant. It's always a treat having the neighbour ladies over. So glad I could offer lady D her favourite Whiskey, the correct <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivas_Regal">Chivas Regal</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The original 12 year old Chivas Regal bottle - read about it on Wikipedia.</span></i> bottle. Anyway, it was a great evening and J was also present for a while before he'd leave for his, let's say, obligations...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						As one of their punishments (another was a short essay about Abraham Lincoln), J had to help out at a quiz evening due to being late for one appointment in Barcelona. I have my reservations about that, but let's just say that they all agreed to play along and do it. J and his friends had the best evening. It was also a bonding time between the involved teachers and students. It will be something he takes with him for the rest of his life for sure... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" id="jma">
						Some more stuff happened the last days, I am collecting it all for the day when I have some more time. I have photo proof of it, it's not forgotten.

						So, two days passed and it feels the time just passes by faster than one says "hang on wait a minute"... Today the coffee was especially appreciated, an early start kicked-of; some calls and things to finish before the weekend.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The last couple of days I have actually taken some pictures thinking that I will use them for posts here. I just didn't have the time yet. The effort is not lost, I will use them for sure.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						...and today after work; H's colleague P delivered J's moped. It's been welded and since we could not get a shock absorber was an rubber placed in the old suspension placed so that J can use it before the new one arrives. It's not easy to find as I tried to order one upfront without success. It proved to be similar issue for a craftsman - and the right measurement is 300 mm long, no more no less. Which is not a standard apparently.  
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Other things around the house; J is off on a birthday party this evening, tomorrow study for Physics, guitar lessons and later in the evening he needs to do service at a party as a collective punishment because being too late to an appointment while being in Barcelona. Life is hard...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						That is just until Saturday; enough for now. There is so much going on at the moment. Life will soon drastically change and we simply enjoy all that there is still. One thing is for sure, it will never come back so why not enjoy it while it lasts!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It's been a lot more and I hope remember to share all my ideas here soon. With that said, I better aim for the bed. Need to be ready to tackle the next thing popping up... Polestar issues (luxury problems with pigeons and USB-c), the lawn, water quality in my pond, office and work related news, Swedish passport related, J school and summer plans, back with work related travelling, new responsibilities at work, Netflix and TV shows we've discovered lately ... the list is long!
					</p>

						Another day passed fast like lightning. The biggest news is that I finally got around to book a time at the police - offices for administration - to get my passport extended. I have dreaded it for some time. When I last tried to do it the waiting time was just unreal. I read in the news about huge waiting times now when people are applying for passports after Covid. I finally saw that the Police implemented a mandatory authentication step when making reservations, I thought I just had to do it as well. Before it's getting even worse. I almost spilled my coffee when I saw that the first free slot is in January 2023 !!!!!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						After a couple of searches, I found a freed up time on the 2nd of September 2022. I will monitor any earlier times that are freed up (that's the tip from the Police) as they will work to have more available. Apparently there wasn't a real control on what people booked, and that's the reason why it's much stricter to reserve a time since yesterday. The validity of my passport and the Swedish ID card are ending mid June, hopefully I will get finally a time around that... Time will tell.

						Today was officially the first day back from the Covid <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fa-solid fa-virus-covid"></i> quarantine (but still tired, a lot of coughing and mucus everywhere). Work wise I was back some time ago... practically I never left. It was a busy day with a lot of important calls, ground breaking day, in fact. New developments when it comes to projects that I am directly involved in, but also new technology and strategies that the company I work for evolves towards. Interesting times!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Other interesting things are how things are developing in Europe. If you talk a lot with people in all parts of Europe <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fa-solid fa-earth-europe"></i> -  people from Spain, Italy, France, Bulgaria to middle Europe like Germany, Hungary, Belgium (of course) to the most northern parts; the Scandinavian countries (of course). It's clear that we all share the basic opinion; how crazy the world has become! Pandemic (figures are not looking good), brink of 3rd world war (despicable Russian war crimes <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-angry"></i>), energy prices (petrol, electricity reaching ridicules levels)... where are we headed?  But I am sure the good will prevail. Sounds like the worst marketing catch phrase for a Hollywood movie <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="fa-solid fa-clapperboard"></i>. But it's exactly what it is, completely unreal!

						Another night of coughing, the coughing is the worst, all day and all night. Might sound strange, but as a back patient it's especially tricky as you have to be in a good position when coughing otherwise you can strain yourself. Not very good as it can lead to a hernia... On a positive note; I feel that some energy is back, now I can complete the stairs in one go.

						J did a negative Covid test this morning. I was surprised by the result, it must be due to the fact that he had it once and have the best protection - fully vaccinated and "natural" protection on top. Nice for him to start the Easter holiday, put all the school stress behind him for a while and enjoy some time off.

						Crazy, half of 2022 is almost done. J will have his Easter report - grades - today. It will be more of an indication on how he is doing. It's his last day before Easter holiday and they had a big Physics test today. Why? I really don't understand it since it's not included in the grades they get for this period. It's very difficult subject and no one is motivated so the result will be terrible. Nice start they give for the next semester to the kids. Nice done.

						Hate them shitty pigeons. I have officially declared war against pigeons in the tree above that are "dropping unwanted excrement's" on my parked car. I have been thinking on what could be the best solution; I have seen fake owls and snakes that would supposedly scare the pigeons away. Or, and probably the most efficient, is to simply cut off the branches above the car...
