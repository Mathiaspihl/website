						A couple of days have passed until my last update. It's just crazy how time passes these days. Christmas and New Year celebrations passed and we are charging up for school (students and everyone employed by schools alike) start. Most of us also enjoyed some time off to recharge our batteries.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Talking about holidays, I have taken today off to arrange some stuff. I thought that I would have plenty of time and could really plan out my day to maximize the day. But all of a sudden, believing I will have enough time, it's already passed 16 o'clock...Crazy <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grimace fa-xl" style="color: #d60e00;"></i>! I am starting to panicking about lack of time.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						When I was back from my holiday last week, it started all at once. Everything - work and life - started on all valves. My plans on a slow start was wishful thinking. At work; projects and plans came to life. There are discussions about travelling and planning out resources, deadlines, priorities etc. Of course this comes at a time when life is busy as well. "Murphy's law" ...to use another infamous epigram.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">

					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Maybe the most exciting news I can share, is that we finally found our holiday destination for the summer. We booked our holiday to&nbsp;<i class="tooltip"><a href="https://visitmadeira.com/en/where-to-go/madeira/">Madeira</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Madeira looks really nice and I have only heard good about it.

						2023 is history and 2024 has just started. What will happen in this year? Hopefully there will be more good things on our path than bad. We can only hope. 2023 was certainly a great year, we shared a lot of nice moments and I was fortunate to do some great travels with my loved ones. We were blessed to be included and share life with our son who's transforming into a fantastic young man. It is amazing to be able to share those wonderful and important moments in life.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The last couple of days were great (but we missed our neighbour ladies) and to close 2023 with a bang, the New Year celebration was especially great! Strangely enough, it feels like it happened weeks ago, probably because of everything that happened. The first workday after such a nice time off doesn't make it any easier. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						In between I took some time to do some, and I would call it doing some "relaxed research", in web development, layout and design. It is mostly oriented around Hugo, GitHub, Netlify, Cloudflare and also what is possible with service providers like Namecheap etc. I also checked out the writing platform Medium again. It's changed a little bit, but I like it. I published a <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://mathias-pihl.medium.com/leave-the-world-behind-a-glimpse-into-societal-collapse-with-julia-roberts-in-a-gripping-role-72e5d60c45c9">little article</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">My article about the movie "Leave the world Behind" in my place at Medium.</span></i> mostly to try out all the new functionalities.

						On a technical level I did some reading up on 3D printing (input shaping in the firmware from Prusa is getting more mature), internet development (one interesting article was about Waku, the minimal React framework...). My son J. is also writing a paper as an English assignment and that got me reading up on how to write academic papers and the tools and systems available. Very interesting!

						Today was an eventful day and of course everything happened in one day, like it was squeezed in purposely in one one day. All the calls today - privately and professionally, changing of the winter tyres <i class="fa-regular fa-snowflake fa-xl" style="color: #87acee;"></i> in Brussels, some orders were planned to be delivered and J needed to be in Antwerp... all for today.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						...but yesterday was a special day, we had a fantastic night out at a restaurant with our neighbour ladies on a Wednesday. Great to have an enjoyable time being able to listen laugh and share everything amongst dearest friends. As a bonus, the food at the restaurant was great. I had a "game stew" with a baked pear and a Westmalle trappist beer. Pure enjoyment!

I did not celebrated it traditionally, but it was certainly not anything less with how it turned out. Sure, I miss how I used to celebrate it and sure it will always be sentimentally attached to my childhood (which is the theme lately). But it is certainly not a bad thing, it is only a proof that I had a wonderful childhood.

						Today is a day when I can focus on work with limited interruptions. I am seriously considering blocking one day in the week to have these "focus days". It is very productive. Ploughing through emails and focusing on deliverables and sipping coffee. Talking about coffee by the way, I have begun drinking <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.dallmayr.com/deen/coffee/prodomo/#prodomo-filter-coffee">one of the coffee types</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about the coffee called Dallmayr Prodomo on their home page.

						The weekend that was, passed by with lightning speed. It was crazy, madness I say. So fast that I had issues remembering what happened. I do remember I worked a lot in the floor planner application called FloorPlannerCreator at <i>floorplancreator.net</i>. I tried out a couple of them until I found the right one. It's really great! I also did some work in the fantastic and well known design solution called Canva.com! The AI, or magic functions as they call it, is impressive! This online solution is a great service that I strongly recommend when doing any kind of design work.

					<p class="main">
						After a challenging workday, it is especially nice zooming out and relax with the family. Tomorrow H. has her doctor's consultant appointment and J is going off to school. On Thursday I have an appointment to change to winter tires...so for now, NOTHING!

						Again, it's been a while since I posted something here and now I thought, "why not a morning post like before", to go over some things that keeps me occupied with a nice cup of coffee. Sipping coffee while the sun raises over the horizon and see how the morning turns into day is really the core idea of this website.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Since I was alone yesterday, the plan was to do some work on the website last evening, it was the perfect opportunity to write a post, doing general updates here and there and continue developing the future website solution (I have big plans in store, but more later). But that clearly didn't happen, after chores around the house were done I had payed some bills which led me into some further "Christmas shopping research" (spent time on shopping sites like bol.com, Amazon, Banggood, 123-3d.com etc) before it was time for dinner (while watching a very nice episode from Kalle Flodin's Youtube channel) it was just too late for anything.

I can really enjoy watching him now and then.

						It's been a couple of days - from mid-week until the weekend. It's been on the edge of being too much at work for both of us, so being able to slow down and spend a couple of days together in our own pace was perfect. I took a recup-day on Friday and the master-plan was to start with the Christmas decoration (and not just decoration here and there... No, it the full-blown <i class="fa-solid fa-gifts fa-xl" style="color: #ff2600;"></i> deal here) and prepare our garden for the season (having friends over, drinking&nbsp;<i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulled_wine"> mulled wine</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about Glögg, Glühwein and svařené víno etc. on Wikipedia.</span></i> in the nose-dripping cold with the garden heaters on). I am very happy with the result and it was satisfying working in the cold, moving things around and preparing the flowers and trees for the cold to come.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						This morning we arranged a little <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas">surprise "Sinterklaas" breakfast </a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about this important especially day in the Benelux region.</span></i> before we drove J's girlfriend K. to work.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Now we are all having a little bit of a Sunday-blues at the moment, as you have after cosy times. Like every year, I am downloading every "Julkalendern" episodes (from 1st of December we have 24 episodes to look forward to). We did not yet start watching it, but soon we will. Like every year, it is a tradition, together with tuning into the "Julkanalen" radio station (dedicated only to Christmas music) to get that Christmas spirit flowing.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						In addition we had time for other chores around the house, the weekly call with my parents and we could also spend some quality time with the youth. The highlight for me was finding a great Christmas gift ever for my&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-xl" style="color: #f60404;"></i>&nbsp;which is so satisfying. I find that being the best with Christmas, finding the best gifts. Fantastic.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, that will be it for this time. I need to head for the bed...
