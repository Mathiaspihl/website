						As you can see, I started writing this post yesterday, but then things came in between and I never got around to publish it. But I decided to keep what I wrote in the entry here below.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The youths are back home from the trip to Narvik and Troms√∂ (Norway). Safe and sound. We, the four of us, have just enjoyed dinner with all the stories from the past week. It's a great feeling to have them back from their adventures and see how they enjoy life! I am sure they are enjoying life a little bit extra, both of them received their results from their past exams and they have passed everything!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday we really enjoyed a dinner with our neighbour ladies. We ordered out from our favourite Asian restaurant, talked, laughed and played a dice game (called "keer op keer"). And laughed some more. It was just a fantastic time...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						It was a crazy week for the rest. The TV installation is working, the solar panels are also OK and then we had a strange power outage. A long story short; the electrician had to pass by and it was discovered that one damaged connection was the issue causing an isolated power outage in the bedroom and my office (obviously an critical issue for my work). It is just madness how it all happened the same day (have I ever said that before?) when both our cleaning woman A and the window washer Y are here, I also received a lot of deliveries and some of my calls I had to use my cellular phone... just to mention a few things that went on. Oh and yes, we had to replace our TV decoder as well during this ordeal...Anyway, all ended good.

						Today I had a rather relaxed day, a bit slow and tired from yesterday's party night. We were invited to friends - friend M and B were the hosts - last night. It was a very nice party, the theme of the evening was <b>wrong</b>. Everything was <i>wrong</i>; wrong gifts were handed out, wrong food was served and we all wore wrong clothes.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was nice with the distraction last night as the youths were travelling to Sweden (a flight to Stockholm) and Norway (the train from Stockholm to Narvik) yesterday. They had a flight from Charleroi airport in the morning and I drove them there. It was a drive that took almost 2 hours one way with the morning peak traffic. I was in the car for 3.5 hours. The drive back was much smoother and it was good that I could do some work (I attended two work related calls) as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I have actually kept this site updated of more technical nature.

						Another start of a workweek done, more than that, family dinner done as well. A lot of calls and lots to do in between as well today with mixed feelings. I discovered a rather disturbing work related email that I, for obvious reasons, can not discuss here. I just get upset when I discover such disconnect and unwillingness (or stupidity) to collaborate from certain teams. But it comes with the work I guess.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						...so the text above was actually written yesterday, but I didn't have the time/energy <i class="fa-solid fa-bed fa-xl"></i> to complete the whole post and left it for today. Thus, here we are. I have just updated the "did you know that ..." post below.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We had a late celebration dinner at home for J's birthday on Saturday. It was a really, really evening/night with the family. The atmosphere was really joyful and everyone <span class="tooltipimg">enjoyed it&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/a4/32/ZtiBalf4_o.jpg" alt="Birthday celebration">It was such a nice night!</span></span>, we all felt like coming together and celebrate.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						On Sunday J was studying for the German exams he had one on Monday and one today. I went to an event that <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.lauwers.be">Lauwers</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The homepage of Lauwers.</span></i> arranged to celebrate their 50 years in business. Friend K. asked if we couldn't join him, I went alone as H. was busy helping J. out with some German. It was actually really nice to see K. and hang out with, let us just say, an older crowd. The presentation about travelling in Bosnia Herzegovina was really interesting. It certainly gave me some ideas for future travels. <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina">The country</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on Wikipedia.</span></i> seems to be beautiful and it certainly has an interesting history!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Yesterday and today J had exams and, from what we can see in pictures from friends, he is now enjoying some time out kicking back <i class="fa-regular fa-heart fa-beat fa-xl" style="color: #e60000;"></i>. Hopefully it went fine, we didn't hear too much from him. <i class="fa-regular fa-face-frown-open fa-rotate-by fa-xl" style="color: #10097c; --fa-rotate-angle: 45deg;"></i> In the meantime, I endured a late heavy work related call... Puhh, it was heavy and a discussion on an intense level. I think I made my point clear in the end and that I designed an acceptable approach of the specific problem. Yet another solution that I  never will get any gratitude for. It comes with the job, I guess.

						It was a cold but very nice winter day today. A few sub-zero centigrade, full sun, blue skies in the afternoon. I could not resist but to take one of my many calls today during a long-walk to make the best of the situation enjoying the&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">beautiful scenery&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/61/ab/wHq6o09n_o.jpg" alt="winter landscape">Check out the beautiful scenery I enjoyed during my walk earlier today!</span></span>.

						Stupid TV...well, it is not really the issue of the TV. We are just unlucky, I guess. A broken component, same as in any TV these days, can always happen. I am more getting annoyed at the service. Today it was proven that it really depends on who you talk to, who is handling your specific case. Twice we have been lucky, proven today thus, as we had another experience today. H. was on the phone with an - and let me formulate this in a polite way - a true idiot! Luckily it was H. on the phone, I would have caused a minor meltdown. At this my wife and I, and probably 99% of the population, are lightyears apart. I would have started attacking the idiot on the other side rather than staying cool and play the game. In most cases I can keep it together and be clever about it, but if I have to start all over again explaining what happened and justifying that indeed it is covered by warranty and that we bought the "bloody TV 1.5 month ago...I am the freaking customer you idiot"! Yeah, it takes a certain intelligence that I have been spared of. Luckily, my better half is Einstein on that level...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						OK, I believe that would be the update for today. Oh, wait, that is not the complete truth. I took my drone out for a flight today as well. I wanted to check-up on how the solar panels are doing (after the storms some time ago and the recent cold weather with snow and ice) and recorded the coolest videoclip! There is some snow and ice on them but they are all in good health. All looks fine!

						Two days of snow, it snowed especially yesterday, and the forecast promised more snow today and colder later in the week. It did not fall any snow so far, but it feels like it can start any minute. It is cold enough to keep the thin layer of snow and ice <i class="fa-solid fa-snowman fa-xl" style="color: #000000; "></i> that we have currently.

They errors are always automatically resolved, but we wanted it to be checked. At around 10 am a person arrived already with a spare part - I believe it was a new inverter - ready to be changed. He explained that some of these parts had issues after a software update. After about an hour of work and 20 minutes without electricity, it was all done. If I check the model number I can see it was a "downgrade" - from 3124 to 3104. Probably to a more reliable version..? Time will tell if it was for the better...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Another interesting development was the case we have with the broken TV. Since we heard nothing from the repair company - the reseller is subletting it out to an external party - we contacted the shop and asked how to proceed. It was a very nice person who dealt with it again and he even remembered us and the issue. The conclusion after the call is that now we have a new plan. Apparently they are giving the repair company 10 days to have it fixed, if they are not able to do it we will get a new TV from the shop. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						The extremely funny thing - well, more interesting I'd say - is that after we had the service person from Balti Solar over and when the electricity was back on again, we all of a sudden had the picture back on the TV. Just like magic <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles fa-beat-fade fa-xl"></i>. The problem is not resolved, it is very much visible, but we can now watch a program at least. Isn't that weird???

						Another work week started - J should be doing exams now (keeping fingers crossed) and H drove to her work early this morning in the snow. Yes, the snow started falling yesterday night and then some more this morning. The whole week will be cold:ish - the forecast says between 0 centigrade down to about -5 and snow.

Of course. But then it was right back to a complete day of studying for the exams that he is doing today. People called and messaged him throughout the whole day, probably a welcomed break in most cases. To give make it more of a proper birthday, we had booked a restaurant in the evening - just him, K and us.

						With inner&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-hands-holding-child fa-xl" style="color: #005595;"></i>&nbsp;happiness - after hugging J goodbye - we strolled through the streets to the car in beautiful Antwerp. The city had a relaxed feeling, not a lot of people out and the atmospheric decoration lights were still on. We took in everything while slowly walking hand-in-hand in the cold night.

						A couple of days have passed since my last update. It's just crazy how time passes these days. Christmas and New Year celebrations passed and we are charging up for school (students and everyone employed by schools alike) start. Most of us also enjoyed some time off to recharge our batteries.
					</p>

						Talking about holidays, I have taken today off to arrange some stuff. I thought that I would have plenty of time and could really plan out my day to maximize the day. But all of a sudden, believing I will have enough time, it's already passed 16 o'clock...Crazy <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grimace fa-xl" style="color: #d60e00;"></i>!

						When I was back from my holiday last week, it started all at once. Everything - work and life - started on all valves. My plans on a slow start was wishful thinking. At work; projects and plans came to life. There are discussions about travelling and planning out resources, deadlines, priorities etc. Of course this comes at a time when life is busy as well. "Murphy's law" ...to use another infamous epigram.

						2023 is history and 2024 has just started. What will happen in this year? Hopefully there will be more good things on our path than bad. We can only hope. 2023 was certainly a great year, we shared a lot of nice moments and I was fortunate to do some great travels with my loved ones. We were blessed to be included and share life with our son who's transforming into a fantastic young man. It is amazing to be able to share those wonderful and important moments in life.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The last couple of days were great (but we missed our neighbour ladies) and to close 2023 with a bang, the New Year celebration was especially great! Strangely enough, it feels like it happened weeks ago, probably because of everything that happened. The first workday after such a nice time off doesn't make it any easier. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						In between I took some time to do some, and I would call it doing some "relaxed research", in web development, layout and design. It is mostly oriented around Hugo, GitHub, Netlify, Cloudflare and also what is possible with service providers like Namecheap etc. I also checked out the writing platform Medium again. It's changed a little bit, but I like it. I published a <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://mathias-pihl.medium.com/leave-the-world-behind-a-glimpse-into-societal-collapse-with-julia-roberts-in-a-gripping-role-72e5d60c45c9">little article</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">My article about the movie "Leave the world Behind" in my place at Medium.</span></i> mostly to try out all the new functionalities.
