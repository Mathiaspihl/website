						Damn, how time passes quickly! A new month is almost upon us. Not just any month, but the Christmas month. Times of joy and happiness... or so they say. I find that it sounds a bit miss placed and strange in the times that we are in with war, greed and conflicts. But maybe it is extra important to celebrate this year just for those reasons?!.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						My workdays are completely full, a lot of things to do, which is of course good and it's what I prefer. It's just a matter of priority and accepting that some things have to wait. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						One interesting thing that I have spent some of my private time on is researching and watching YouTube clips on is related to AI tools and machine learning. A lot of interesting things are happening in AI and specifically in the area of writing- and video-/image and audio creation. AI tools is actually helping out with the research and writing the text.

						OK, interesting... So, when you'd search for STL files - models to 3D print - you will at some point come across Skådis, the pegboard system from IKEA. I guarantee that you will. I have a Prusa printer so I logically use Printables.com (these days it's not specifically for Prusa printers, even though it's owned by Prusa) and there there are loads of objects for <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.printables.com/search/all?q=sk%C3%A5dis">Skådis</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Have a look here on the search result for "Skådis". It will give you an idea on how much there is!</span></i>. And it looks like a fantastic system and there are loads of tailor made stuff... so, I just bought two Skådis boards with some basic stuff (for storing some 3D printing related parts and tools). There are LOADS of stuff to print and design for it, I'll keep you updated for sure... <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-grin-tongue-wink fa-fw"></i>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was a very busy work week which ended on Friday in the office in Brussels. The important presentation I mentioned earlier went great, so that was a big relief. Especially when I had to squeeze it in with everything else that went on at work. Exhausted but a very satisfying week overall!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">

                        Where do I start? It's been a busy last couple of days at work and private. The business trip to Germany is all arranged and done. Some critical items were done in the biggest European wide project that I am the Program Manager (solution architect, project manager are also roles that applies to me) for. Demanding but interesting for sure.

                        One of the things that kept me busy, after work, is the interesting project that J. is the technical director of. I can not say too much, but it involves buying a domain and creating a website. There is also some 3D printing involved (yeeey) for prototyping that I am involved in. Super interesting!

                        I was blessed to have a slow start and easy going morning before starting with chores. Everyone in the family went off to do their thing; guitar lesson, helping out with clean-up and giving away Mokkas stuff (finally a suitable time slot).
                    </p>
                
                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        All the stuff from Mokka have been tucked away in the trunk of the car for a week now. Out of sight. The animal caretaker O. was really happy getting all that stuff - it was more than I remembered - and it will help stray cats.
                    </p>

                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        I managed to squeeze in a mini 3D print today as well - it was only a 15 minutes print - one of the quickest I've ever done. It was a dual color print again and it's a top secret project. It's a new way of printing for me, but I really like doing it since it's very easy to change filament (the print job will pause for you to make the change and then resumes the print) on the Prusa Mini+ printer.
                    </p>

                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        Yesterday drove to the office in Brussels. It was a really busy day, but I was lucky with traffic; in both directions. The hotel is booked for the trip to Germany, still pending are the flights. I decided to fly from Brussels (and not Amsterdam), even though I prefer flying from Schiphol airport with KLM. The flight times were not ideal this time - the flight back was either too early or too late. We'll see if the options I requested are still available.
                    </p>

                    <p class="main">
                        Thursday was a very strange day - nice but many of last second planning solutions. J. travelled to Leuven to meet up with friends, he was delayed from school so it was basically getting home, packing his bag and then we had to drive like crazy to the train station to be in time. We just made it. It screwed with our timing a bit, so we decided to go for dinner in a restaurant. It turned out - Google search (thanks Polestar) for the nearest restaurant - to be a great <i class="tooltipimg">Thai restaurant <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/68/c1/JxAaRYF9_o.jpg">Fantastic food at the Thai restaurant called "Mu Daeng".</span></i>.

                        While I am writing this this site is still down. Something happened (probably stupid user error. I was fiddling around in the DNS maintenance section of the domain registration) and the site was broken. I have just been in contact with Namecheap support department and they instructed what I had to do. Now I have to wait until the changes are applied. Time will tell if it is resolved...

                        We met with friends yesterday in a very nice <i class="tooltip"><a href="http://www.tinestoof.be">restaurant</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This is the cosy restaurant called "Tines Stoof" in Malle.</span></i> called "Tines Stoof" (translates to Tine's stove) in Malle. The cool thing was that you're almost eating in someones kitchen. The cook is actually preparing the food where we were sitting. The center piece of the interior is that old solid AGA stove. The owners of the restaurant is a keen whiskey collector and he also brewing his own beer (called <i class="tooltip"><a href="http://www.tinestoof.be/tornado-bier/">Tornado</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This is the beer that the owner brews, we bought 3 of them and a bag of his coffee to try out.</span></i>) and they even have their own coffee brand.

                    <p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        For the rest, it's very busy at work. In one of my projects there are a specific "unwanted behavior" that the customers are making a big fuss about. Almost all the resources are utilized on trying to resolve that specific issue.
                    </p>

                    <p class="main">
                        Another interesting development related to work, is that it looks like I have to travel to the Munich office in the beginning of December. That will be very interesting and actually rather nice to do. I will visit the team there which is always nice. The only small hassle is the current traveling policy at the moment, it's still very restricted and needs approvals on a very high level. I'll see how it goes, the process started at least...

                        Interesting! So, this site was down for a while due to an "internal glitch" according to the support of <i>Namecheap.com</i>. A fantastic support service by the way. After the 3rd time contacting them over the online chat, it was resolved. The means of communicating (the location was for sure in an "exotic location"), safety policies followed and resolution is simply brilliant. I am dealing with these kind of questions on a daily basis and I am impressed of the service that they delivered. So, apparently the DNS entries, the host details, were somehow corrupted. The only strange thing is that it happens at the same time as I am fiddling around with my new registration (J's project) of <b>RatRaceAntwerpen.com</b>.

						It was a particularly nice day today. Nice and relaxed Sunday breakfast with matching cup of coffee. The weather was super nice today, a bit too nice?

						We decided to go for a walk, while the earth is still spinning (too fast?), in one of the nice parks that we have here around the corner.

We are doing a nNice piece of meat with Chinese cabbage (cooked in butter and olive oil, salt and pepper). No carbs tonight.

						The last couple of days - luck for us that Friday was a public holiday - have been dedicated around arranging the practical stuff around Mokka's passing. We have been cleaning out and packed away all her stuff, getting it ready for donation. We decided to give it all away to the person/organization that cares for cats like Mokka.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday H and I decided to drop everything and enjoy the evening at a restaurant, the distraction was certainly needed with some cosy time. The food and drinks did wonders as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We had our friends A. and P. from The Netherlands over for lunch today. It was great sharing some laughs and silliness with our friends.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						It's strange how Mokka is still with us, it's almost that I can hear her sometimes. When I go down the stairs to get to the ground floor, I automatically look for her through the front door. For a split second I expect her to come running. Today I found flowers and a card placed where her little house used to stand. It was from "an animal lover". Not sure who that is, but I have my suspicion...

We had to take the difficult decision (by the strong recommendation of the veterinarian) to put her to sleep.

						We are very sad at the moment, the wound is open and it is difficult to handle, she was a part of the family and now we have lost her. It's a small comfort that we made sure that the "second part" of her life was full of love and life quality.

						It's been a heavy day, a lot of stuff to be on top of. Taking the outcome, it was not a bad day at all. Exciting and challenging is how I would summarize it. Spice that with great batches of coffee and you'll be pretty close to my reality.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						A lot of frictions between teams to deal with, heavy duty project management and some coordination as well... that is what I had to deal with at work today. Again, not negative. In fact, it was really inspiring actually! I had to squeeze everything in today as I have taken tomorrow and Wednesday off. Friday is a public holiday here as well, so I do not have a lot of days to play with. One cool thing is the support that I had from my direct management, which made it a bit easier to deal with.

					<p class="main">
						So for now, that is it. I just wanted to do a quick update on the very latest. Tomorrow is also an eventful day; a bit more studying/planning, try to take Mokka to the veterinarian and we will see how it goes with the Arborist appointment that is booked for tomorrow...

						Today was a day starting at 100% at work and kept on going full speed ahead until the late evening. Constant in calls and I had hardly time for anything else. The rest of the family were busy as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was a special night yesterday with our neighbour ladies. Special on so many levels that it's difficult to even put words to such an evening giving so many conflicting feelings. It spans from the positive news all to taking in the great ordeal that is also happening. Well, it needs to be sinking in for a while I guess. It's also comes at a time when there are other news that still sits with me. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We also recently started to think concretely on that this year we celebrate 20 years being married. Of course it's been ups and downs, but seeing the phot album today from that special day in December 2002 just makes it so obvious how right our gut feelings were. I am truly a lucky, lucky individual how things finally turned out!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						As a small little side project I decided to buy two domain names today with my trusted provider Namecheap again. Let's just say that I saved two of the most important dates - 21st of December 2002 and 14th of January 2014 - in my life. More to come...

						Darn it. I forgot to mention that we saw the recent movie called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3704428/">Elvis</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on IMDB. My mom, a huge fan of Elvis, will certainly love this movie. Austin Butler makes the performance of his life...</span></i> this evening. It's a fantastic movie that I can not recommend enough. Absolutely great!

						A new month today and we are rapidly getting closer to a new year. I can't believe that we are already in November. My older brother J turns 54 soon, which is also another proof on how fast time goes...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Plans changed a bit (=completely changed) today - it was a complete day of studying more Excel with J. It's not easy at all and some stuff I actually learned as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						We are visiting our neighbour ladies M and D this evening. Looking forward hearing how things are going with them and how it is progressing with D.
