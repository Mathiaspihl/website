						Today came the crescendo of the work week, one call after the other which then culminated in one call with global participants. It went great, to be honest and was probably a real eye-opener for some of the participants. The frustrating part was more that it left no time for anything that I had planned for the day. Anyway, I took the time to have lunch (almost 30 minutes before I had a call) in the garden enjoying the nice weather<i class="fa-solid fa-sun fa-beat fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #fda50d;"></i>with a nice cup of coffee.

BUT, the new normal these days, the plans changed. He is now meeting with his friends. Before he left to meet up with his friends however, we could enjoy a great dinner together, talk and laugh, just the 3 of us.

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow we will meetup with friends M. and B. in Antwerp for a game of Escape room<i class="fa-solid fa-skull-crossbones fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #ffffff;"></i>and then dinner. It will be a great laugh to see them again.

						Today was one of those days that just flew by - workwise (a lot of strategic and critical planning related stuff), leisure, logistically (J. to the hairdresser, picking up K. from train station) and chores. The weather is crazy warm today. I think that these couple of days will officially be the Belgium summer of 2024.

If I remember correctly it is a French company behind it, always interesting voting for the underdog in the game, I think. I wanted to see if I can use the Claude model with Ollama, but no such luck since Claude is not opensource. I found, however, an interesting&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.llama2.space/llama2-vs-claude">comparison</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">The very interesting article is here...</span></i> between Llama and Claude.

						We have decided to celebrate the beautiful summer day today. We are in a summer holiday mood. Even-though there are still a couple of weeks until we can go full out. J and K are here and soon there will be some friends of them turning up. When? Well, no one seems to know. But OK, we will (try to) not interfere with their "plans". The friends arrived just on this very moment, they are spoiled by H. cooking and our service, that is what creating memories are all about.<i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-lg" style="color: #db0000;"></i>..for us as well.

						The work week starts again after an absolutely fantastic weekend. It was however, in a positive way, a bit weird atmosphere. Unusual, is probably a better word to describe it.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We had our neighbour ladies over for dinner on Friday night, then Saturday we drove to Brussels to meetup with friends that we have not met in ages. It was great to catchup with them again, a really nice time in Overijse with friend J's in her new house together with friend E. and their boyfriends. Then after that we had to head back home to be in time for the next appointment - namely brother in-law's birthday party. It was a very busy Saturday, but it was a really nice day!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday I took the time to fly with my drone. It was finally great weather for it and I could also check the solar panels on the roof. Check out the drone flight here:

								<p>Finally I could take out my DJI drone for a flight and compile a little video clip in Shotcut. It was a nice flight spanning from 30 cm to 52 meters above the ground.</p>

It's a nice city and one of his friends at school live there. J and a couple of friends went there yesterday and had a great time together after the exam period. Tonight he left with his girlfriend K to go and work at the metal festival called Graspop. I wrote earlier about it and provided a link for more details, but now it's in the news due to the extreme wet weather which is making the situation problematic - the festival terrain is basically under water and mud. Let's hope it goes well!
					</p> 

					<p class="main">
						We are also trying to finalize some holiday plans, we are hoping to have some time to go to Sweden this year. But, for reasons unknown, it is more difficult than ever to find something available for a good price. Everything seems to be booked out... Anyway, now it's time for bed.

						Today it is cold for the season, rainy and generally a grey day. I am enjoying some leftovers for lunch and soon I will have to drive J to the tram station. He has one of his very last exams (still one to go; French tomorrow which marks the end of the exam period for this time) today.

						We are home alone this evening, and we are planning a decadent dinner with meat, fries (served with a real pepper sauce) and wine. How is that saying, "when the cat's away, the mice will play". Maybe I will have a picture later...

It is always great to receive filaments; to see the colour in real life and imagine the projects that will match. But I also ordered a PEI heatbed plate for my Creality 3D printer. As you can see it is the original Creality gold plate kit. Meaning that it has the bottom part that glues stuck and then on the other side a magnetic coating on which the PEI plate rests on. This is a rather big thing on a printer having the old school glass plate.

						Another perfect Sunday, chores around the house but mainly it was to the the garden in order. My mission was getting the back-terrace tiles clean from "the slippery layer of bird evilness"<i class="fa-solid fa-poop fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #541612;"></i>. Yes the terrace is located under trees - below the meeting place of all the birds in the neighbourhood it seems. "yes, come and sit down right here next to me and take a dump my friend", is what the evil birds are telling each other. I can just hear them! Their friends are sitting in another tree above my car at the front of the house...
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was a nice day with a nice result after all the work in the garden. Nice and pretty and the terrace tiles are like new. It was planned to go to a restaurant, but we decided to have a cosy dinner at home since the youths have a very busy week, starting off with exams. It continues with celebrations, meeting up with friends and then they will work at a festival called&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.graspop.be/en/"> Graspop Metal Meeting</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">This is one of the bigger metal music festival, an old school rock event.

						It was a great Saturday. We just didn't care about the strange weather - one minute is it like the rain is going to start any second and then the sun came out. Then extremely windy and then the rain did came, then back to sun again...you get the picture. We just didn't care and went out to continue getting the garden in order. We still had to finalize the hedges and clean up around the flowers and plants. I cut the lawn (everytime I use our lawnmover I am so impressed that it still work. Last time I had to clean the electric spools in the motor) and trimmed the edges and I also spent some time to improve the water pipe that goes from the water filter back into the pond. 
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The youths came together in the afternoon, J had to continue the studying but they joined us sporadicly in the garden now and then during their breaks. Fantastic times.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow we will have to continue some gardenwork (hopefully I can clean the 3-chamber water filter) and then in the evening we will have an night out with the youths in Antwerp when we drop them off at the apartment there.

But this is something that we find being one of the perks of life and, I would even go so far to say that it is what I consider to be the meaning of life. At least it falls in that category.

						Today the weather can best be described as whimsical. The sun can be shining and then all of a sudden it's grey and cold. Will it start raining or do we carry out the cushions and get the outdoor sitting area in order? I will observe the weather mostly from inside sipping coffee today, I think.

						The air compressor was delivered in the week. Normally it was initially planned for 19th of June, but now I received it 14 days earlier. I am really happy with it, it's bigger than I expected, really solid and nice quality. It was delivered by UPS<i class="fa-brands fa-ups fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #000000;"></i>, it's not often used and I have a feeling that it's the best carrier company. The local post company here is BPost which is also good (often it's the same delivery person) and the worst are GLS and dpd, there are often shady people turning up in soft pants delivering parcels with zero service mindset.<i class="fa-solid fa-skull fa-xl"></i>

						OK, just a moment ago (irrelevant for you) I made some updates on this site. Notice the background image? For the person into detail you spot it at once. Yes, it is my fabulous 4 EUR mechanical keyboard from Temu you see in the background. So far, I am a fan of this little keyboard.
