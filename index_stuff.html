                        <p>So, nice that you dropped by! The idea with this is really to learn, share ideas and thoughts and - at
                            best - knowledge. It all started when I was checking out how to set up and website (with
                            CMS-type functions) using Netlify and GitHub. One thing led to another and it became an interesting "project". At one point you have to just try it out for your self...
                        </p>
                        <p>I like the idea of K.I.S.S - Keep It Stupid Simple. This, I think, doesn't implicate the lack of
                            functionality. Like Einstein said, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no
                            simpler". I love that quote! So with that in mind, I wanted to go back to the basics with this
                            site. Creating everything myself from scratch in a text editor, making it <i>lean and mean</i>. Going back to
                            the roots, like how I started out back in the early '90s. That said; I did a littlebit of research and found that with VSC text editor,
                            Netlify and GitHub I would cover the hosting and also the CMS-type of requirements. Of course; it's work in progress and I'm still tweaking the process etc.</p>

                        <p>On another level, I felt it's actually needed in times of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok...and I feel everything is just snowballing. The digital footprint it
                            consumes and the social influence and impact it has on all of us is just <b>crazy</b>!</p>
