                        <p>So, nice that you dropped by! The idea with this is really to share ideas, thoughts and - at best - knowledge. It all started when I was checking out how to set up and website (with CMS-type functions) using Netlify and GitHub.
                        </p>
                        <p>I like the idea of K.I.S.S - Keep It Stupid Simple. This however doesn't implicate a lack of functionality, like Einstein said, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler". I love that quote! So with that in mind, I wanted to go back to basics with this site. Creating everything in a text editor, making it <i>lean and mean</i>. Going back to the source, like how I started it back in the early '90s. Writing and learning it all from scratch. That said; I did a little research and found that with VSC text editor,
                            Netlify and GitHub I have a nice little framework covering the hosting and the CMS-type
                            solution. I'm still tweaking the process though.</p>

                        <p>I felt it's needed in times when everything is Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok...and all of those are just snowballing. The digital footprint, the resource it consumes and the social influence it has is just crazy!</p>
