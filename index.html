						I especially enjoyed the coffee this morning, the fantastic pot of coffee was shared with J. He studied most of the day and shared his plan to go for the exam of Financial Management  and not wait with it for next term. It's a baldly move since he also have the exam for Law and order to study for. Anyway, it's nice to see how he plans and learn. J and I picked up J's girlfriend K at the tram station, just before some interesting calls I had to attend. I was glad to get out and enjoy the fantastic warm and sunny weather - it was 30 Celsius today.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Today I also did a 3D print, a request to 3D re-print an existing old object, the two part soap dish. Both parts were 3D printed in white PLA and then the post-process was done with applying Epoxy layers. I printed the tray part today in <i class="tooltipimg">Golden PLA <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://www.123-3d.nl/image/REAL_filament_goud_175_mm_PLA_05_kg_DFP02071_DFP02071_large.jpg">This is a great PLA, the brand "REAL" always deliver with great filament.</span></i>

						It's already 8th of June, the month just started and BABOOOM we're almost in the middle of the month.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main">
						I was looking forward a relaxed pace this morning, but then we remembered an appointment we had made for this morning, a last minute booking done at the hairdresser. I could forget about the "relaxed morning". Luckily I was able to have the conference call I could do in the car went fine, so that's good.

						The earlier post was written some 8 hours ago... Something came in between that I had to jump on and then there were some more conference calls and work to do. Again, KAWABOOOOM, it's evening again. And that how the days passes by.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						So what's happening the last couple of days? I finalized the network setup; I decided to bring all the Raspberry Pi:s onto the new subnet IP range. Work great. But, I am just starting to get annoyed on how slow our "family computer" (an HP all in one computer) is. Is it due to the new internet/network setup?
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						The DJI customer support experience has also been a pleasant experience so far. So, I discovered that the controller stopped working (in short) and I contacted online support (friendly person who I started chatting with online) who recommended to send it back. It's always a weird thing to pack it in and send it by post. It's like, "will I ever see it again", kind of feeling. I mean, it's gone and a very (expensive) important thing. Without it I am not able to fly my <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB3lOAFgxGk">precious drone</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">It is an absolutely fantastic drone. The complete concept of the drone - the flying capability, the software, services and the overall experience is fantastic! Have a look at this clip to understand what it's all about... I love it! </span></i>. It is a very satisfying feeling when I get all the emails from DJI support/customer service ensuring me that it's "all good". I have received messages saying that "we have received your controller and currently doing the investigation". Then earlier today I received the message that, "...all is good. The result is that we will fix it and send it back to you for free". It continued today when I received emails (in German of course... good that I am practically fluent in German) from <i class="fa-brands fa-dhl fa-2xl" style="color: #ed1a02;"></i> DHL that is handling the logistics. So far, it's been spotless!

						Today was a different day, not sure where it went. Completely crazy how fast it went! On top of it, or maybe just because of it, it's a Sunday and that why it felt even faster. Enough with the theory. The weather was again brilliant today which was nice to enjoy but made it difficult for J to focus on studying. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I was busy most of the day trying to resolve the issue with my network <i class="fa-solid fa-network-wired fa-xl"></i>  which happened after the technician was here from Proximus. It took some time before I figured out what the root cause is, slowly but steadily I could tick off the issues from the list. Satisfying on one hand, but frustrating at the same time as it's very time consuming thing to work with. Long and complicated story, but all came down to that my private network was moved to a different subnet, with a different network mask. If the technician would have told me, my life would have been much easier. Basically, I was busy fixing the conflicts, moving my devices into the correct IP range, fixing local web applications (<i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.opendocman.com/free-download/">Opendocman</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it here on the homepage.</span></i> was especially a struggle), setting up the media computer with all its dependencies and services.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Luckily I could alternate the geeky stuff with enjoying the weather sitting in the garden, study support to J and doing some chores around the house and other planned obligations.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow is a big day for J, he has his first exam <i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap fa-lg" style="color: #000000;"></i> (something like within business financial) for this period. It seems he has a good understanding of the content, but again with no margin over and his plan is to study until the last second. I really hope he does well, he deserves it! If he would have followed some of the plans from us he would not be in such a stress now... Sorry, just saying.

					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Friday ended with spending hours to fix out home network and internet as I had to get a technician over from Proximus to resolve the issue that I struggled with most of the day. It resulted in a new modem/router and also a brand new Wifi "booster". We should have great coverage now! What the technician forgot to mention is that I have now a complete new internet service, new network with completely new IP ranges and LAN services. Probably he didn't know my network setup. Not a lot of people have this setup at home. We never stop learning... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We enjoyed an absolute fantastic evening last night with son J and his girl friend K. We received the great gift from K (how cool is that) of a "candle light concert". Indeed, what is that? It's a trio playing classic instruments and this performance they covered Queen songs with their normal violin, an alt violin and a cello. Imagine all this happening in a church hall covered with live lights. Absolutely spectacular! The experience only got better with the fabulous interaction that they had with the crowd! Later, when we walked back to the car through the city of Antwerp, it was pure magic. The parents went back home together with a huge smile, J and K stayed. We both enjoyed a perfect evening, a memory for life! 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I have just completed a very satisfying 3D print, a bag clamp. It only took 1 hour with a perfect result. Another very satisfying thing was that I send away the remote control to get my DJI remote control repaired. Not sure if I mentioned it, but it just stopped working and I can not for the life of me understand why it happened. I am very curious how that will work out...  
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Anyway people, I really have to go to bed. Last night was very late, I could not enjoy the bed before 2 am as I was trying to fix some of the network issues I still struggled with after the Proximus technician was here...

						I was cleaning up and freeing up some additional disk space on one of my Raspberry Pi's - the one that is running a surveillance camera like system. It's based on the Python solution referred as <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en">Picamera</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The fantastic Picamera Python solution.</span></i>.
