I did some writing (but not as much as I hoped for), I had an interesting meeting with friend M. about a potential "future personal project" - I'll see how it goes. And of course, what comes with the season, both of us are doing Christmas preparations on different levels.

						On a technical level I did some reading up on 3D printing (input shaping in the firmware from Prusa is getting more mature), internet development (one interesting article was about Waku, the minimal React framework...). My son J. is also writing a paper as an English assignment and that got me reading up on how to write academic papers and the tools and systems available. Very interesting! I also want to finalize the next version of this website - my Hugo solution. It would be great if I could launch that.

						Today was an eventful day and of course everything happened in one day, like it was squeezed in purposely in one one day. All the calls today - privately and professionally, changing of the winter tyres <i class="fa-regular fa-snowflake fa-xl" style="color: #87acee;"></i> in Brussels, some orders were planned to be delivered and J needed to be in Antwerp... all for today.

						...but yesterday was a special day, we had a fantastic night out at a restaurant with our neighbour ladies on a Wednesday. Great to have an enjoyable time being able to listen laugh and share everything amongst dearest friends. As a bonus, the food at the restaurant was great. I had a "game stew" with a baked pear and a Westmalle trappist beer. Pure enjoyment!

						The weekend that was, passed by with lightning speed. It was crazy, madness I say. So fast that I had issues remembering what happened. I do remember I worked a lot in the floor planner application called FloorPlannerCreator at <i>floorplancreator.net</i>. I tried out a couple of them until I found the right one. It's really great! I also did some work in the fantastic and well known design solution called Canva.com! The AI, or magic functions as they call it, is impressive! This online solution is a great service that I strongly recommend when doing any kind of design work.

						After a challenging workday, it is especially nice zooming out and relax with the family. Tomorrow H. has her doctor's consultant appointment and J is going off to school. On Thursday I have an appointment to change to winter tires...so for now, NOTHING!

But that clearly didn't happen, after chores around the house were done I had payed some bills which led me into some further "Christmas shopping research" (spent time on shopping sites like bol.com, Amazon, Banggood, 123-3d.com etc) before it was time for dinner (while watching a very nice episode from Kalle Flodin's Youtube channel) it was just too late for anything.

It's been on the edge of being too much at work for both of us, so being able to slow down and spend a couple of days together in our own pace was perfect. I took a recup-day on Friday and the master-plan was to start with the Christmas decoration (and not just decoration here and there... No, it the full-blown <i class="fa-solid fa-gifts fa-xl" style="color: #ff2600;"></i> deal here) and prepare our garden for the season (having friends over, drinking&nbsp;<i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulled_wine"> mulled wine</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about Glögg, Glühwein and svařené víno etc. on Wikipedia.</span></i> in the nose-dripping cold with the garden heaters on). I am very happy with the result and it was satisfying working in the cold, moving things around and preparing the flowers and trees for the cold to come.

						This morning we arranged a little <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas">surprise "Sinterklaas" breakfast </a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about this important especially day in the Benelux region.</span></i> before we drove J's girlfriend K. to work.

						Now we are all having a little bit of a Sunday-blues at the moment, as you have after cosy times. Like every year, I am downloading every "Julkalendern" episodes (from 1st of December we have 24 episodes to look forward to). We did not yet start watching it, but soon we will. Like every year, it is a tradition, together with tuning into the "Julkanalen" radio station (dedicated only to Christmas music) to get that Christmas spirit flowing.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						In addition we had time for other chores around the house, the weekly call with my parents and we could also spend some quality time with the youth. The highlight for me was finding a great Christmas gift ever for my&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-xl" style="color: #f60404;"></i>&nbsp;which is so satisfying. I find that being the best with Christmas, finding the best gifts. Fantastic.
					</p>

						OK, that will be it for this time. I need to head for the bed...
