						It was a really long trip, not so much in distance nor in time, but it just felt like an extremely long trip, when we finally arrived in Äppelviken, Sweden. But, after all, it went fine.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Just to give an idea; after a whole day of working (last hours before holiday is always madness), we drove to Amsterdam airport. We were stuck for 40 minutes in traffic due to a terrible accident. Luckily we had planned with some margin. Then in the airport, all restaurants closed at 21:00 o'clock which is just unbelievable that an international airport do not offer decent meals in the evening. The choices are already limited to start with. But then again, The Netherlands is not a culinarian country. The flight was fine and the seats and service with SAS is not to be compared with those other "cheap money saving" airlines. We landed 00:15 (15 minutes in on 25th of July) and  receiving the checked-in luggage went smooth as well. We had a little bit of searching before we found the bus that would take us to the car rental area. Positively surprised about the car model, fits us just perfectly for our needs. It's the first time that I rent from Europcar, I have always used Hertz, so that was a new experience. I am now a privileged customer. <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-tongue-wink fa-xl"></i>
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Yesterday was our first day in Stockholm. We were all very tired, but we enjoyed it to the full. It was such a great day being back in Stockholm. Probably the most beautiful city in the world...

						Has it been that long? Yes, more than 2 weeks passed since last update around here. But it's been a holiday in between without a real possibility of updating. I could have done it (via the iPad and the GITHub compatible remote connection app that I have installed for the very same purpose. I used that same app to keep the site updated last year when we travelled to Greece). I guess it was being lazy and taking the opportunity of completely enjoying the holiday. Madeira and the location where we where is absolutely fantastic. <i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arco_da_Calheta">Arco da Calheta</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">This is truly a magic place.</span></i>&nbsp;(west of Funchal) and the surroundings is simply a magic place! I took hundreds of pictures, so expect more to come.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I am writing a quick update here today just before our next travel - holiday number two. This year we have the luxury of two travels - Madeira and Sweden - both happening in July. We are taking the flight from Schiphol (Amsterdam airport) again, pretty much same procedure as last time concerning those arrangements. I prefer Schiphol to Zaventem (Brussels) airport. Then in Sweden, we will be staying in Bromma after some hassle during the Airbnb booking. We also rented a car for the period that we are in Sweden. After some research, it is the most cost efficient arrangements if we take everything in consideration that we want to do.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, now I am finishing up at work as much as possible, finalize the packing, charging the car and then we will soon take off.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J. and K. are here and are also included, if only in the periphery, in the plans of things to do. They have just come together after some individual activities. Funny, because it is really showing the differences between teenage boys and girls. Do I need to spell it out who spend the last couple of days working, thinking about the budget for upcoming costs needed expenses that might come when travelling etc. The other person prioritized to meet with friends, try out golf and chilling. Guess who did what...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Let's see if I get some time for more updates before we leave, but I plan to bring a laptop with me if possible. It is always practical to have the option to search internet and do some lookups about the place when Wifi connection is a rule rather than exception.

						OK, so the workweek is done. It is now history. Over and done with. So it's been a full week full of interesting, fun and annoying things happening.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Tuesday was fantastic exciting, J. had&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">his performance&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/45/fc/xaH4mXr2_o.jpg" alt="performance guitar music">It was an absolutely crazy great performance. Parents insanely proud! Note the photagrapher below the stage on the left... a proper performar! The whole night, such a friendly and inspiring night with friends and random friendly people turning up and showing their support.</span></span>&nbsp;in Lier. The parents were probably more nervous that the person who would actually perform. After some clarifications and messaging H. and I strategically decided just to turn up at the performance more or less unplanned. At a VERY particular and timely time. It turned out to be a fantastic night, we drove a friend back and only arrived at home around midnight. But so, so worth it!
						
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						H. had a insanely crazy busy week. Always the last week before they close down before the summer break it is pure craziness! Then, guess what happens, I receive a message that the Airbnb apartment in Sweden will not be available for us. An apartment that was booked and confirmed already. It's a very long and annoying story, but it comes down to that we, the four of us, had no where to stay for the booked trip to Stockholm in 20 days... After some stressful days we found an apartment that was still available. It is not easy to find something in the area we like (and for the purpose of the trip) for the time already booked. "Long story short", it turned out great. Seems that we found an even better apartment after the ordeal of having to go into the nitty-gritty details in all available options. Now we are in the very nice are of Äppelviken in Bromma. Even closer to my brother! It turned out all good, but what an annoying thing we had to deal with on-top of everything else...
						
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						OK, and then we are Friday. Today thus. I had an garage appointment to change into summer tires. I know, embarrassing late. Due to circumstances, that is just how it is. I was extremely lucky with traffic (the garage appointment was strategically booked and it paid off). As I was one hour earlier and managed to get that slot, I was home again at the time of my original garage appointment. I have  a long history with them and I personally know the manage there - thanks D. - as for some 15 years or so I have been a customer there. That means, when I have my summer tires on, it is officially summer. It is perfect in time, H. is now also officially on the summer holiday. I still have next Monday to go....then we are off to Madeira!
