						Today was a day like any other day. At least that is what I started writing. My strong belief is that NO day is like the other! Everyday is an unwritten page... Everyone should be more thankful and think every every morning as they open their eyes, "thank god that the sun rises today"... Especially these days, these crazy days that we all are experiencing! That is a fact, right?

						I have done some updates here (one small cool thing is visible on this page, can you spot it) on the site; the monthly update is done and I have extended a new cool set of icons (from Nerdfonts.com) that you will enjoy as time goes by. There are also some cool resources added to my Bookmarks page (all about a very interesting text editor in Linux/Mac world related to Vim, called Neovim&nbsp;<i style="font-size: larger;" class="nf nf-custom-neovim"></i>).

Again, more details on my dedicated website but just to let you know that the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/en/product/wi-fi-adapter-esp-01s-for-mini-and-mk4/">adapter</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">I bought the ESP module some time ago, finally I could install it!</span></i> was installed to bring the 3D printer natively on the network.

						As you can see, I started writing this post yesterday, but then things came in between and I never got around to publish it. But I decided to keep what I wrote in the entry here below.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The youths are back home from the trip to Narvik and Tromsö (Norway). Safe and sound. We, the four of us, have just enjoyed dinner with all the stories from the past week. It's a great feeling to have them back from their adventures and see how they enjoy life! I am sure they are enjoying life a little bit extra, both of them received their results from their past exams and they have passed everything!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday we really enjoyed a dinner with our neighbour ladies. We ordered out from our favourite Asian restaurant, talked, laughed and played a dice game (called "keer op keer"). And laughed some more. It was just a fantastic time...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						It was a crazy week for the rest. The TV installation is working, the solar panels are also OK and then we had a strange power outage. A long story short; the electrician had to pass by and it was discovered that one damaged connection was the issue causing an isolated power outage in the bedroom and my office (obviously an critical issue for my work). It is just madness how it all happened the same day (have I ever said that before?) when both our cleaning woman A and the window washer Y are here, I also received a lot of deliveries and some of my calls I had to use my cellular phone... just to mention a few things that went on. Oh and yes, we had to replace our TV decoder as well during this ordeal...Anyway, all ended good.
