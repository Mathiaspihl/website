Pity that the A-06 model is sold-out. I just HAVE to take the RPI-CM4 - Raspberry Pi CM4 - version...</span></i> device. What a cool little handheld device in all-metal casing with a nice screen. Retro-looking too...everything is just too cool about it! Unfortunately there is one think that really suck! I can only order it from US which means I have to pay VAT, shipping and customs costs. The price for the little beauty is $189 and the shipping is $40. That would have been OK. But I will have to pay 39€ and then 21% on top of that. It might be that there are other <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://financien.belgium.be/nl/douane_accijnzen/particulieren/pakketten/extra-kosten-verbonden-aan-mijn-pakje#q1">hidden "handling" costs</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Ridiculous costs if ordering from outside EU. The legislation is also "clear as mud"...</span></i> (something called "duane rechten" which I am not sure about) at customs in Belgium. It means that for something that costs $189, I finally have to pay at least 270€. Ridiculous!!! <i style="font-size: 20px; color: red;" class="far fa-angry fa-fw"></i> I guess, I can only dream for one...

						It was a tiresome day today. I was tired to start with, which was completely my own fault as we were invited for a Valentine dinner at friends yesterday night.

						After the Migraine ordeal, and luck I did not have it two times, I am back in business. It's always taking an additional day to "get back in shape" and recover completely.

Something common like migraine is not fully understood. Before we explore other planets, universe and beyond, we should maybe prioritize and put the focus, resources and energy on resolving something very basic, present and actual as sicknesses...

						I did not search migraine for fun. Yes, I had it yesterday as well. 8 months since last time, for me is that not so long ago. Normally it goes years between the attacks.

						I will have the loan car for a long time it seems, my car will be fixed only sometime in the first week of March. I will have to return the car I currently have tomorrow, that was from the toing-/road assistance company. A very nice BMW that I didn't mind driving. Let's see what I will get from the leasing company for the remaining time.

						This evening seems to be more of a relaxed one. J is home and hopefully we can enjoy <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"> "Last of Us" </a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about this fantastic serie on IMDB</span></i> together.

						Just as a little side note (searchable memory notes for me); I have started exploring NextJS (built on top of React) and GraphQL (Hygraph) as new web application technology. It really is interesting technology. I have created a test application in NextJS that queries Hygraph (previously known as GraphQL CMS) CMS system. Today I got it running fine for the first time. Really cool!

						It was somewhat a busy start of week this morning.

						Is it possible to go back to Friday? Friday evening? Or maybe if I could turn back the clocks and start over from 11:00 on Saturday to be more precise... No, I guess not. That is not how it works and I am sure I learned something and that there was a universal purpose somehow...

					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Then, still Saturday, we decided to visit Antwerp (luckily not with the new car), have lunch and then visit the <a href="https://museumplantinmoretus.be/en">Plantin Moretus museum</a>. It was to celebrate the new car and all the nice things that happened lately. But then destiny had other plans... We were in a car accident. I don't have the energy and mood to go into the details just yet as I am still processing it. The good thing is that there were no injuries and the everything went really smooth. In all the misery... I'll see how the administrational paper work and insurance process goes in the week.

						I am enjoying the freshly made coffee and trying to get something installed (not easy, it always gives issues.

						I have a funny story to share. It's funny now after it happened, but when it happens you are really stressing out. At 01:40 J calls and in our sleepy state we miss the call. We try to call back but it takes some time before we actually get hold of him. That is the time when you stress out and imagine all sorts of things... When he finally answers, he is asking if we know where the toothbrush is. <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-surprise fa-fw"></i> Can you imagine?!

						..And shmackabooom, we are in February all of a sudden! It's been a more relaxed day at work than yesterday when I had a whole day of remote "workshop". Following a meeting via webcam and headphone for 5 hours is not what I dream about...
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J and K were also staying here yesterday while I was 95% of the time busy in the meeting. But what matters is that they had a nice time together. It was the last time they could meet before spending a week apart - she is travelling to London and J to the Ardennes with friends. At lunch J left with a friend who drives the whole way there which is, as parents, always a worry! But he texted me saying that they all arrived there fine. Waiting for pictures now...

I have already fitted the heat-sock on there and it fits perfectly! I started preparing for the Wifi-module; first step is to upgrade the firmware. The firmware and the bootloader were successfully flashed to the 3D printer. Now I just need to fit the hardware into the controlboard.
