						J. came home today. It's always so nice seeing his face, talk with him and hear how he is and how the last couple of days have been. We were "home alone", so we enjoyed a Netflix documentary (we continued watching the one called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29026379/?ref_=ttep_ep7">"Spy Ops"</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">We started seeing the episode called "Taliban Spies", which you can read more about on IMDB.</span></i>) while eating the dinner.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Not sure if I mentioned it, but I have finally found and bought some eBooks to my Kobo e-reader. I am so happy having some Swedish crime fiction books again. It's not the easiest - I checked a few of them but finding a store in Sweden that supports an address abroad is not the easiest. Finally, I "hacked the system" and could make a purchase and download my <i class="tooltip">two eBooks <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-question"></i><span class="tooltiptext">"Dödligt hot" by Jan Mårtensson and "Offermakaren" by Viveca Sten.

						Today was one of those days. Woke up at 5 am because I had to go to the WC - the worst time ever - and could not fall asleep again until H.'s alarm went off. So annoying when that happens but that's how it is now and then.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						For the rest it was also one of those extremely busy days at work. At least I had a fantastic moment in the garden enjoying one of the last sun rays of this season. The season between an "Indian summer" and autumn. It is a magical, weird, warm and cold (multiple levels) time. The strange thing is that it seems that everyone are going through the same too. The people I speak to are all of the same opinion, it doesn't matter if you live in Bulgaria, Sweden or US; we all agreed that we are living in strange times. Just take everything that is going on at the moment, Ukraine (we all know the complexities it raises in Europe), Israel (triggering frictions all over the world), gangs war in Sweden (due to integration issues), the situation in US (the internal issues they struggles with is unreal), China (the scary things happening in Africa in the background and the total exploiting happening there)...madness! I can continue until an absolute insanity. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, I had the plans of doing some more updates here (like the short drone movie I prepared, some content on of how I resolved the recent 3D-printing issues, the vernissage...stuff), but now it is time for dinner. Let's see if I will have time to do some more updates.

						OK, so not much happened today except that it was a pretty heavy work day. It started with an outage of one of the systems that I am responsible for. Never a nice start of any day, especially a Monday morning... But again, only work related. Luckily, with the right coordination, it was resolved in 30 minutes. The aftermath demanded (which is not fully done yet) more work than resolving it. 
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday was a magical but strange day. Utterly strange, it will take a long time explaining it... It was like everything done was made for a reason, it was like everything that happened to prove a point. Unfortunately, when I write this, I am just too tired and I have to still massage it in my head for a while. In short we are talking about stuff like a vernissage, randomly meeting a dear friend to H we have not seen in 25 years. Later when driving to Antwerp and sharing a unique moment with J and K to top it all off, we also met our neighbour who reached out for help while we were parking. All happened in the afternoon within a few hours... I will certainly share my thoughts about it as it comes.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I did some research and finally have a nice solution of buying Swedish books. The method of paying is finally working. For the last 25 years, buying books has been a thing for me and until recent it's been a thing when travelling back to Sweden. It was never a concern when driving with the car as I can bring what ever I find. It's a different thing when flying, it's not possible to bring back what you want with the ever increasing restrictions. Before, the only restriction was what ever we could fit in the car. Amazing what we brought back (rocking chairs, flowers, kitchen tables, chairs, trees, moving boxes of stuff)...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Well, a lot to come back to... and I will because every topic is a post and important to write about. Take good care of yourself, now I have to get some sleep...

						The weekend is running into it's last hours and, like most of them, it passed by too fast. It feels like I am not ready for the week just yet. But that is something we can't change and, no drama what so ever because it was been a great weekend and I can't complain.  
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday was a weirdly busy afternoon when we were constantly running late in our schedule. It was due to the walk we did which took longer than expected and after that there was no means of "correction". Then, all of a sudden, there were loads of stuff to do (preparing starters, sorting out pictures from our youth that we needed to bring, dressing up in 70:ies clothes...) before we could leave to go to friends in Oostmalle. We were very late, but the welcome was unbeatable; they were standing on the busy road in front of their house all dressed up in 70:ies clothes welcoming us. Too funny! The theme was 70:ies and we had to prepare foods (we were in charge of starters thus) that we remember from our youth; it was great and we had a lovely time! 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We arrived home around midnight and our youths were having a little party at home. How do they say, "when the cat's away, the mice will play!" No, most of them behaved perfectly. There was some girl-drama, but nothing exceptional. What was absolutely heart warming was that the boys - J's closest friends - wanted to "say hi to the parents". Us thus. Together with the 5 big boys we were all squeezed into our little kitchen talking childhood memories <i class="fa-solid fa-child-reaching fa-xl"></i>. They were talking about how they remembered were playing at our house; building camps under our kitchen table, played with Playmobile, chasing around shooting each other with Nerf guns <i class="fa-solid fa-person-rifle fa-xl"></i> etc. Yes, they were a little bit tipsy, but they were open and honest and how nice is it for a parent to take part of it, to hear those kind of things? We are a part of their memories that they will bring with them for the rest of their lives. Magic! 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						We are now about to eat dinner with J. and girlfriend K. Unfortunately K. is not feeling that great <i class="fa-solid fa-viruses fa-beat fa-xl" style="color: #b00707;"></i> and they will leave to their apartment in Antwerp soon. The worst timing, but due to the early start tomorrow, it will be the best for them to be there. We have also said that we will drive them both to Antwerp after dinner.

						Schawaaaapahhh, and 16% of October has already passed. Contemplating with a nice cup of coffee that it is only 3 months to Christmas. The really crazy thing is that it is forecasted to be 25 centigrade this weekend. Madness, I tell you! <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-tongue-wink fa-xl"></i>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J. came home yesterday and then left in the evening again for Antwerp. "The evening" was the plan at least, it became very late before he was ready to leave. So late that we decided to go for an evening drive to Antwerp and drive him to where he had to be. J. and I were in charge of cooking the dinner yesterday (while I am writing this, the song "father and son" by Cat Stevens is playing. Imagine that!). The time flew by in the kitchen and was partly the reason it became later than planned. However, the food turned out great - a couscous dish of some sort - and it was a great "father and son" moment as well. <i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-xl" style="color: #e30202;"></i>
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Last time I was 3D printing I ran into issues. While I was 3D printing PETG for the first time, I ran in to a serious clogging issue. It took me ages before I got the hot-end cleaned (I had to take it apart, heat it up to 240 centigrade and carefully remove the filament that was stuck), I still have a serious clog in the extruder somewhere (where the filament is fed into the machine). Due to the encapsulated design of the Prusa printer it makes it more complicated. At first glance I can not see any jammed filament there, but the part is stuck and I can not get it out. I have to take it apart, when I have time, and have a better look... Crap! 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, time to get into action. There have been some intense days at work, a lot of the stuff going on and it seems to happen at the same time. A strange time! A refill of the coffee and head back to the home-office to start the day. What does the workday have in store for me today..?

						First day of the month October and it could not have been a nicer day celebrating its start. Warm with full sun, a blue sky and no wind. Except the chores and some other events we also took the time to enjoy a nice time in our garden. Picking apples, pealing, cutting them up in pieces and putting them in freezer bags is a very satisfying feeling. When we defrost them to make apple puree with cinnamon during the winter will give a magic feeling knowing it's all from our garden.

						J. was studying today and we could also go through the "master plan" for the rest of the term including all the practical stuff around planned travelling and other important milestones. I can't believe it's already evening, after the dinner (a fantastic oven dish) we are about to sit down in front of the TV for our TV-series.

						I did some quick research about free video edit applications for Windows. Something comparable to iMove in Mac. I finally settled for <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://shotcut.org">Shotcut</a><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about this very interesting video edit application.</span></i> which seems very promising. I quickly did a little video clip out of the recordings from the last drone flight when I inspected my solar panels on the roof. I will try to post it here if I can upload/share it somewhere...
