						Ohhhwieeeeee, it's Friday at last. And we have no real plans for the evening except our dinner with J. and a movie (it will be the new "Top Gun") for tonight. What a treat!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						OK, so the exam that J did today seemed to have been OK. It's difficult to say if there was no correction done and J doesn't like to make any assumptions before hand, but still; I was surprised when he said that he thinks he passed it. We'll just have to wait and see how he did. The positive is that he is passionate about it, it seems to be a good direction in his education that fits him well. We also hear about connections and interactions he is making, a lot of it is within music. J has been playing guitar for 7-8 years and has a real talent for it. He's been sharing some of his creations. One thing leads to another and all of a sudden it reaches the right person and... it's how life is.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						For the rest, it was a busy working day with some critical conference calls. One, and it just happened to be the last one, was a real eye-opener! More to come on Monday... A new global project will also commence as of next week as well with a lot of focus on. Something big turned immense all of a sudden...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Another thing that I have been researching privately was some artificial intelligence services provided out there. I have explored the extensions available for internet browsers and even the latest Google AI service called Bard... like if that escaped you. It's only available in US and UK, but I <i class="tooltipimg">have tried it out already<i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="700px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/fc/c6/lAPJwRCF_o.png">Here is a little sneak peak on how it looks...</span></i>.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, all of a sudden (not really, we were out watering the garden in the meantime) the time passed 23:00 o'clock and I am completely exhausted. Tired! Let's see if I still can do some reading or/and watching Youtube documentaries...

						Today was a day full of conference calls. The day ended with a call to inform us about the future of one specific project. It's especially interesting for me as it potentially involves a lot of travelling in central eastern Europe but also in Middle east. It was an interesting call, but we'll just have to see when we get the specific details about the scope etc.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was another extremely warm day today, no wind and full on sun, at least 30 C. (in the shade). After work I tried to enjoy sitting in the sun but after 15 minutes it felt like I was fainting of heatstroke.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						J keeps studying now 100% (he is having sometimes some discussions with his parents on what he need to focus at) of the time without his K. He is doing it so good, the little "skatt" of ours...

						Today was a classic working day, with some exceptions of course! Interesting calls (I especially looked forward to speaking with my colleague Sandrine) and other no so much. More a feeling of what a %#$% waste of my time. Anyways, it's all in my working descriptions apparently.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I received the Remote Control that I had to send back to be repaired. I received a new one (not sure if it's a new one or something that they have repaired already) but after some initial issue (they did not properly insert the connecting cable between the RC and the mobile phone) to get it connected with my drone, a software update and finally an acknowledgment of a new device that is connected to my drone (I actually thought that is amazing) I was able to do a little flight over the rooftops (even with a small <i class="fa-solid fa-video fa-xl"></i> video recording of our solar panel installation) today. Oh, how I love it!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						J was studying good today, H met with some colleagues for dinner and I managed to throw something together (a vegetarian paella mix together with a lot of left-overs which made it certainly not vegetarian anymore). I was happy with the result! Before I took all the pillows in for the night I could enjoy the summer evening with a nice Achel Trappist beer. It was really a moment of full enjoyment! I came to the mental realisation that all is actually extremely good! It was one of those micro holiday moments...

						So the work week has started, the first day is already half gone in fact. I certainly enjoyed the much needed coffee <i class="fa-solid fa-mug-hot fa-shake fa-xl"></i> this morning.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The Pizza dinner with the youth yesterday was great. J looked tired and maybe a little bit nervous for the exam today. It's been a lot of catching up in the few days he had to study. It's certainly not been the easiest in this heat-wave that we are having at the moment, it was still <i class="fa-solid fa-temperature-high fa-xl" style="color: #ef1901;"></i> 28 C at 23:00 o'clock  yesterday. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I got the scare of my life yesterday night when driving home from Antwerp (after have dropped off the youth there). I was riding in the right most lane and all of a sudden the car in front of me throws himself into the other lane on the left. Only then I noticed that there was a car maybe 50 meters in front of us standing still in our lane with the Hazard warning lights on. It was too late to brake, there was a car close behind me, so what I did was only possible with the Polestar 2 (dual motor, Long Range with 408 hp), I hit the "pedal to the metal" to accelerate enough to clear the car left of us. Only then I could change the lane to avoid (only by centimetres) an <i class="fa-solid fa-car-burst fa-fade fa-xl"></i> accident. I think it took me about 5 minutes before I could breath again..!

						It's been a typical cozy Sunday, the youth studied most of the day; and still they are. Poor them, not easy studying (or doing anything for that matter) in this heat. No oxygen and we all are feeling very flat. We are enjoying every second when the youth (son J and girlfriend K) are here, so therefore the parents are feeling little bit blue since they are soon off to Antwerp and the week begins.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It's been a great and productive weekend, we did a lot of work in the garden. Really fantastic being out and doing some physical work. Very satisfying seeing the nice result. The little gray cloud on an otherwise a clear blue sky is the pain in my back. Well, it is something I have to live with and take into consideration in anything that I do. But sometimes it's very frustrating!

It's a baldly move since he also have the exam for Law and order to study for. Anyway, it's nice to see how he plans and learn. J and I picked up J's girlfriend K at the tram station, just before some interesting calls I had to attend. I was glad to get out and enjoy the fantastic warm and sunny weather - it was 30 Celsius today.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Today I also did a 3D print, a request to 3D re-print an existing old object, the two part soap dish. Both parts were 3D printed in white PLA and then the post-process was done with applying Epoxy layers. I printed the tray part today in <i class="tooltipimg">Golden PLA <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://www.123-3d.nl/image/REAL_filament_goud_175_mm_PLA_05_kg_DFP02071_DFP02071_large.jpg">This is a great PLA, the brand "REAL" always deliver with great filament.</span></i>

						Now the youth is out enjoying themselves in an idyllic surrounding, the parents will enjoy a glass of wine and some homecooked meal and our TV show streaming on Netflix or Prime at the moment. Could also be a downloaded Swedish series. It's Friday, we will decide...

						It's already 8th of June, the month just started and BABOOOM we're almost in the middle of the month.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main">
						I was looking forward a relaxed pace this morning, but then we remembered an appointment we had made for this morning, a last minute booking done at the hairdresser. I could forget about the "relaxed morning". Luckily I was able to have the conference call I could do in the car went fine, so that's good.

						The earlier post was written some 8 hours ago... Something came in between that I had to jump on and then there were some more conference calls and work to do. Again, KAWABOOOOM, it's evening again. And that how the days passes by.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						So what's happening the last couple of days? I finalized the network setup; I decided to bring all the Raspberry Pi:s onto the new subnet IP range. Work great. But, I am just starting to get annoyed on how slow our "family computer" (an HP all in one computer) is. Is it due to the new internet/network setup?
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						The DJI customer support experience has also been a pleasant experience so far. So, I discovered that the controller stopped working (in short) and I contacted online support (friendly person who I started chatting with online) who recommended to send it back. It's always a weird thing to pack it in and send it by post. It's like, "will I ever see it again", kind of feeling. I mean, it's gone and a very (expensive) important thing. Without it I am not able to fly my <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB3lOAFgxGk">precious drone</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">It is an absolutely fantastic drone. The complete concept of the drone - the flying capability, the software, services and the overall experience is fantastic! Have a look at this clip to understand what it's all about... I love it! </span></i>. It is a very satisfying feeling when I get all the emails from DJI support/customer service ensuring me that it's "all good". I have received messages saying that "we have received your controller and currently doing the investigation". Then earlier today I received the message that, "...all is good. The result is that we will fix it and send it back to you for free". It continued today when I received emails (in German of course... good that I am practically fluent in German) from <i class="fa-brands fa-dhl fa-2xl" style="color: #ed1a02;"></i> DHL that is handling the logistics. So far, it's been spotless!

						Today was a different day, not sure where it went. Completely crazy how fast it went! On top of it, or maybe just because of it, it's a Sunday and that why it felt even faster. Enough with the theory. The weather was again brilliant today which was nice to enjoy but made it difficult for J to focus on studying. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I was busy most of the day trying to resolve the issue with my network <i class="fa-solid fa-network-wired fa-xl"></i>  which happened after the technician was here from Proximus. It took some time before I figured out what the root cause is, slowly but steadily I could tick off the issues from the list. Satisfying on one hand, but frustrating at the same time as it's very time consuming thing to work with. Long and complicated story, but all came down to that my private network was moved to a different subnet, with a different network mask. If the technician would have told me, my life would have been much easier. Basically, I was busy fixing the conflicts, moving my devices into the correct IP range, fixing local web applications (<i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.opendocman.com/free-download/">Opendocman</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it here on the homepage.</span></i> was especially a struggle), setting up the media computer with all its dependencies and services.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Luckily I could alternate the geeky stuff with enjoying the weather sitting in the garden, study support to J and doing some chores around the house and other planned obligations.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow is a big day for J, he has his first exam <i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap fa-lg" style="color: #000000;"></i> (something like within business financial) for this period. It seems he has a good understanding of the content, but again with no margin over and his plan is to study until the last second. I really hope he does well, he deserves it! If he would have followed some of the plans from us he would not be in such a stress now... Sorry, just saying.

						What beautiful days we're having here, the weather is fantastic. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Friday ended with spending hours to fix out home network and internet as I had to get a technician over from Proximus to resolve the issue that I struggled with most of the day. It resulted in a new modem/router and also a brand new Wifi "booster". We should have great coverage now! What the technician forgot to mention is that I have now a complete new internet service, new network with completely new IP ranges and LAN services. Probably he didn't know my network setup. Not a lot of people have this setup at home. We never stop learning... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We enjoyed an absolute fantastic evening last night with son J and his girl friend K. We received the great gift from K (how cool is that) of a "candle light concert". Indeed, what is that? It's a trio playing classic instruments and this performance they covered Queen songs with their normal violin, an alt violin and a cello. Imagine all this happening in a church hall covered with live lights. Absolutely spectacular! The experience only got better with the fabulous interaction that they had with the crowd! Later, when we walked back to the car through the city of Antwerp, it was pure magic. The parents went back home together with a huge smile, J and K stayed. We both enjoyed a perfect evening, a memory for life! 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I have just completed a very satisfying 3D print, a bag clamp. It only took 1 hour with a perfect result. Another very satisfying thing was that I send away the remote control to get my DJI remote control repaired. Not sure if I mentioned it, but it just stopped working and I can not for the life of me understand why it happened. I am very curious how that will work out...  
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Anyway people, I really have to go to bed. Last night was very late, I could not enjoy the bed before 2 am as I was trying to fix some of the network issues I still struggled with after the Proximus technician was here...

						I am enjoying a nice pot of coffee, the very first morning in June.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I was cleaning up and freeing up some additional disk space on one of my Raspberry Pi's - the one that is running a surveillance camera like system. It's based on the Python solution referred as <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en">Picamera</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The fantastic Picamera Python solution.</span></i>. Basically a picture is taken and stored every time a movement is detected. Once the predefined folder size (where the pictures are saved) reached I am triggering a process that will take all the images and compile them into a short movie. The movie is moved into a folder acting as a temporary holding location on the SD card. Now and then I have to archive these short movies to my hard drive on the PC to free up some storage. To have these recordings has proven to be very useful, now and then I have a look and detect interesting things. So, the other day I <i class="tooltipimg">saw myself <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/04/bf/Nwa2O55g_o.jpg">There I was, trying out the car washing accessory for the high pressure cleaner.
