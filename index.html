					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						In parallel with everything else, I picked up on Hugo and Bootstrap website development. I went into depth with the structure (and especially the templates) of Hugo. Bootstrap implementation is pretty straight forward. Templating in Hugo can be very easy if you stick to the basics, but you can basically go as complicated as you want. It's a great, great framework. The more you use it, the nicer it gets!

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The ending of the week was full of things to do and planned appointments. The biggest being whether my car was ready or not. Or specifically, if they received the missing part - the safety-belt tensioner. They managed to get two for the left side. I received a minor chock when they called and informed me that they will probably have it on the 27th of March. Will it be delivered by bicycle?
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Then next disappointment, the chimney and heater inspection appointment. Due to the massive traffic jams last Thursday, the inspector was late but called as informed that he was on his way to check the heater. It was clear that something had gone wrong in booking as he was scheduled for a heater inspection only. Doing both would take too long and another appointment was planned for next week. Sloppiness is the new normal these days.

						It was a very early morning today, we got an SMS late last night that the inspector (for the solar system installation) would come by between 06:45 and 07:45 in the morning. He arrived at 07:00 and we were ready for him with coffee. Was it the coffee or a good installation (or combination of both), but it was approved and he was back out in the snow again in 30 minutes.
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It's interesting, every time when there is someone working with electrical installation or phone systems I think back to school when we had this work life experience program ("PRYO" or "PRAO", as it was called) and I was placed in the state owned telecommunication corporation called "Televerket" (it was state owned <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Televerket_(Sweden)">until 1993</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about how "Televerket" state owned company started 1853 and transformed into private ownership in 1993.</span></i>) for a couple of weeks. I thought I'd received the worst place, but I was to be very surprised. I could work together with a cool guy and come with him in the car visiting people for servicing phones or installations. Often we went to very remote places. We even went out with a boat in the archipelago to people living on islands... it was great! 
					</p>
					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow we have another appointment, another inspector coming over. This time it's to have the heater and chimney inspected. On Friday it might be that my car is ready...

						Now and then I get some emails sent through the contact form on this site of various value.

						The workweek started rather relaxed at work, it was my cold that made it somewhat of a challenge. It's not too bad, it's more of an annoyance having a flu, sleeping bad, painful joints, coughing and having to run and blow the nose constantly. I actually did another Covid test today, it's still negative, as it feels worse today than previous. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I saw an <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.dn.se/sverige/alex-schulman-nu-visar-det-sig-att-anders-tegnell-hade-ratt-hela-tiden/">article today</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">I was always pro Anders and the Swedish approach in fighting the Covid pandemic.

He was often criticized for his unique approach on how Sweden dealt with fighting the pandemic. Now, retrospectively it is clear that he was actually right, his tactic was the most efficient and resulted in the country that had the lowest fatality number.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						This week can be interesting. I mentioned that my car might be repaired (I don't put my hopes up too much), but we also have an appointment to have someone passing by to officially do the inspection of the solarpanel installation. According to Belgium legislation it has to be approved by officials - paperwork and administration at it's best. Then on Thursday we have an official coming over to check the chimney and heat installation. Another official thing that need to happen for the home insurance.

						We have planned the schedule of next week. It is absolutely necessary in a family with everyone having their own schedules and parallel lives in a busy workweek that we are all leading. Talking of which, it will be interesting if my car is done, it was promised to be repaired in the first week of March. I have really missed it and I am curious how it's going to feel getting it back, will it be the same driving it, will it feel the same...

						As you can see, I am now using the monthly archiving cycle. For the ones who pay attention to details, I have started doing some cleaning up in the archive too. I have done November included so far, but I will take my time. Obviously it has some impact on the Google indexing and search function that I am using, might take some before it's fully working again.

						The last couple of days I have been monitoring the solarpanels installation. I think it is really fascinating. I was lucky of having two days of full sun and it was charging with 3.7 kW. With that rate the batteries are fully charged at around 13:30. I have been using sun energy 100% so far. Fantastic! Today however, it's another story, the sun went away on holiday, nowhere to be found. Interestingly, the solarpanels are still producing <i class="tooltipimg">enough energy <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/30/23/QnstPlJP_o.jpg">Very interesting to follow along how the solarpanels are performing, what we are consuming and the overall status.</span></i> for consumption, charging of the batteries and give back to the net.
