						Last Friday J. and K. went to a party, it was in the Hilton hotel ballroom in Antwerp. Nice location, but not very well organised from what the youths told me. Maybe not the best event to do (especially if you stay until 04:00 in the morning) before a study weekend... On Saturday we went to friends - friend K. and K. - for dinner in <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechelen">Mechelen</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on Wikipedia.</span></i>. We saw their new house they bought and recently moved into. It is a really nice looking town house, a good location just next to the canal and close to a park. While we were enjoying the evening in Mechelen the youth were babysitting - luckily for them that the kids they were watching behaved extremely well. Sunday was a day to rest and recover. I think we all needed it after the last couple of days' events...

						It feels like the work week just started but in fact it is already Wednesday. We are already halfway. A sign that it goes too fast is that both of us just forgot that our cleaning lady A. was coming yesterday. Guess my surprise when the doorbell rang and she was there... We had completely forgotten about it. It is probably due to the fact that it's been too much going on lately. Or is it a sign of age maybe? <i class="fa-regular fa-face-surprise fa-xl"></i>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Something that I certainly did not forget was the doctor's appointment yesterday <i class="fa-solid fa-stethoscope fa-xl"></i>. It's just the annual check-up, even though it was 2 years ago that I last went. The blood pressure was taken and the doctor also took some blood - 3 tubes of it was needed <i class="fa-solid fa-syringe fa-beat fa-xl"></i>. 5 minutes later I back out on the street on my way home. Yes, we live within walking distance from the doctor's office. It's so convenient, made life so much easier when J. was a baby... The doctor called with the result this morning already with only good news - all perfect results. It was a relief.

					<p class="main">
						A quick note concerning some 3D printing <i style="font-size:x-large;" class="nf nf-md-printer_3d_nozzle_outline"></i> related stuff. I recently started a new little project that is interesting on multiple levels. It is basically to create my own sunglasses. I really like the design aspect as well as the technical challenges it brings. I will just mention it now, but I will absolutely cover this multiple times in a near future. It's because I need to document for my own reference as it is very much a work in progress, constantly working on perfecting the final solution. The tools used are OpenSCAD, FreeCAD and of course the 3D slicer of choice, the Prusa Slicer in this case. The parametrised, almost programming, way of working in OpenSCAD really interests me. Another cool aspect is scaling and also the tracing on top of an image to make the sketch needed when creating the 3D model in FreeCAD <i class="fa-solid fa-draw-polygon fa-xl" style="color: #000000;"></i>.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Finally, after 2 years of negotiations, Sweden joins NATO. It was basically due to two egoistic countries/leaders/dictators that wanted to squeeze out as much as they possibly could. I don NOT understand how NATO could allow that kind of behaviour. Terrible! Anyway, in the end we all see what they go for and Turkey basically lost the initial F-16 deal with US and Erdogan never got the political refugees sent back from Sweden that he wanted. How Turkey is - with a dictator who carries out war crimes against Armenia etc - still a member of NATO escapes my mind! Interesting to know is that the main headquarters are located in Belgium (I can almost see it from my office window) and, what maybe you did not know, the military headquarters are also in Belgium, near Mons to be specific.

						Yesterday we started to watch a new Amazon Prime movie called "Knives out". It's one of those forgotten ones (at least for me) with only A-list actors. All of the actors are super famous, but the movie I just "forgot" about! It received great reviews on IMDB and I must agree that so far - we did not yet finish it - it is really good. I agree with the 7.9 (of 10) rating it has on IMDB.

						It's been a satisfying day so far. A lot of chores done around the house and a refreshing walk and soon we will go to a <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://thecountryclub.be/">restaurant</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about the restaurant called The Country Club 5 minutes walk from where we live.</span></i> here in the neighbourhood. Nice to be able to have some nice choices within walking distance (to <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://brasschaatgolf.be/en">the golf course</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The golf course with a restaurant that we'll enjoy this evening.</span></i>).

						It was a leap year this year, thus February was one day longer. We have to wait another 4 years until next time. Then I will be 55 years old. How weird that sounds. Will I still post stories here then..?

						One of the chores on my list was to finally fix the pump in the pond, now and then it stops (most of the times it is simply clogged and it turns off automatically as a safety feature). While I was cleaning it, I notice that the hose between the pump to the filter (3 chamber filter) it cracks almost straight through. The first thought is that I have to turn it off until I buy a new 38 mm in diameter and 5 m long spiral reinforced pond hose. Then I started to analyse how I could fix it. As a temporary solution I decided to do as professionals - loads of Duct Tape. I found two types of Duct Tape and made sure <span class="tooltipimg">to use enough&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/2b/0e/JNz6DCdu_o.jpg" alt="pond reinforced spiral pond hose">It's working great, at least as a temporary fix! You can see that I have two types of Duct tape, the traditional silver coloured one and then I also used a black one. I am such a DIY guy ;-)</span></span> and it proved to work fine. At least until I have a new one. I checked the price online to get an idea of the price before I went to the local hardware store. Lucky that I did, the price is exactly double in the store, 50 EUR for a piece of hose!? I left it in the store (I do support local business, but I am not stupid) and went home to order it online (I also bought other stuff for the pond in preparation for the seasonal starting up).

						Another cool little project I completed in the last days was replacing the broken keyboard on the laptop. It was a little bit fiddly, but <span class="tooltipimg">the keyboard unit&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/40/60/cyeEvfEo_o.jpg" alt="Laptop keyboard replacement">I gave it a try, a cheap keyboard replacement unit from AliExpress and so far it's really working great! In the background, top of the image, you can spot the laptop without a keyboard. It's actually very interesting how it is assembled...</span></span> I bought from AliExpress is really working great.

						Now we will get us - the youth will also come with us - ready for the restaurant and then start...walking.
