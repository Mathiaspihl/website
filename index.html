						To honour the upcoming National Barbecue Day (not true, I did not know that today is the day) we did the first BBQ of the season this weekend. It's a universal rule that it take at least double the time to get the meat done. Always! Never the less, it was fantastic to have the family gathered around the table on the terrace.

					<p class="main">
						Momentarily I need to attend a call, but I just wanted to start the update of todays post. I have some nice technical stuff to share - 3D printing project progress and the static site generator called Gatsbyjs that caught my eyes. But that will follow soon, now I need to dash.

						As a follow up on the latest 3D printing project, the second related to my drone, namely the travel-box for my drone. Overall it is a nice 3D model that fits my needs perfectly - I want to be able to bring the drone safely in a backpack etc. I downloaded it from Printables.com and it 3D printed fine, no major issues to speak of at all. However, after a short while the lock of the lid broke off. I re-printed the lid (in different orientation thinking it could be stronger) but it soon broke. I decided to redesign the STL file in Tinkercad - it's the easiest way of doing some quick modifications on already created STL files. <i class="tooltipimg">The travel-box <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/55/a1/AKfVH5NB_o.jpg">It's a really nice little travel box that fits my DJI Mini 2 se drone perfectly. You can see two broken lids and the new mounted lid with the new locking mechanism that I designed.</span></i> came out great and I am really happy about the new locking mechanism!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, soon I have a dentist appointment to look forward to. At least J and I are going together. Different this time is the fact that it's the last time we will see our dentist before her retirement.

						It was really a successful working day yesterday. But it took much longer than expected, I wasn't done before around 17:00. I decided to enjoy outside, I jumped on the bicycle and headed into one of the parks. I had my drone with me and found a great spot where I could fly. The weather was however really unstable, but I could fly between the rain showers. Got some nice recording from it as well!

						The plan is to take the time to do some stuff at home, probably driving K to the train, maybe some writing and hopefully there will be some time for 3D printing as well. Let's see what the day brings...

						Today is a strange and different Saturday, it will be a different weekend in fact. It started this morning when I had to logon to work. We have to make a physical database <i class="fa-solid fa-database fa-lg"></i> move in the data center in Germany and some other things. That is always a scary task to do, especially when the database is 2 TB and on two servers. That was this morning, we are still busy working on it. We ran into some problems that needed fixing and it is "normal" that things take longer than expected on complex setups like these.

I am basically shielded off in in the office at home constantly wearing the headphones.

						It was difficult to wake up today, luckily the first call was not that early. I have felt reluctant to drive to the office lately due to overwhelmingly much to do and also due to the extreme traffic situation lately. The other day I was driving to the car repair shop, which normally takes about 25 minutes. It took more than 2 hours and it felt like I had to drive through half of Belgium to get there. I do not mind the driving per se, it's more to be in time for calls (not all of them can be done in the car as I need access to the computer etc) and to be home in a decent time.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J had an exam today in supply chain and I really wonder how it went! Apparently the feeling was not that good (one mistake can have a huge impact), but to be expected as the preparation was limited (to say the least). Anyway, let's hope for the best...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I checked the open source version of ChatGPT (the very popular chat and language interpretation technology using artificial intelligence and machine learning) called Open Assistant. It's completely free and I have seen a YouTube clip and read an article about it which triggered my curiosity. The initial tests I did on the website shows a promising result but I have to try it some more.

						Just back from Antwerp. We have just seen M - the daughter of friends M and W - perform ballet. It was the yearly dance performance that the group arranges. Before the show we had dinner together, it was nice meeting them all and to see how good she is in dancing. Of course there are some who are painfully bad, but it certainly did not take away the experience and the positive atmosphere. J and K are not home yet, we expect them home any minute now. Now off to bed.

						No, I did not fall off the face of the earth. But so much is going on lately that it is difficult to keep track on priorities. It's all being processed as it comes... and of course not according to priorities in most cases. But that is to be expected I guess, when there are so many moving targets at the moment. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						"Moving targets" is a good word, it's really been forget everything and see how it plays out. Today we can finally have our own evening. J studied the whole day (more like 2 hours) for the exam tomorrow (he studied "supply chain" a couple of hours). It is fantastic to see talk with him about it, amazing how much he picks up in such a short time. I wonder if he understand that supply chain is what I have been working with for about 25 years... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was fantastic that I could do some drone flying today. I could explore how to take <i class="tooltipimg">pictures <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/fe/b4/znuVCiIj_o.jpg">This were one of the pictures that I took. Our Lilac is just about blooming and I was hovering in place to take this picture.</span></i> (once I discovered that the mini SD card needed to be inserted). Well, the flight was about 25 minutes (had already used some battery while discovering how to stream video to the network).
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Well anyway, feels like it is Friday already here but now it is time to go to bed. We had a lot happening the last couple of days (in a near future I might have some very special to share in silence). The day in Antwerp with family was very nice. One day I also had to go back to the garage where they fixed the car after the accident (I think I mentioned that they forgot to mount a panel under the hood). It should finally be OK now, but what about the quality control?
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						For now that has to be it. A lot is also going on at work, the travel to Dubai is one example that is still lingering on but should probably be fine. It is to be expected in such a huge project. Anyways, now it is time to go to bed for sure...

						It is a new month and a public holiday in most of the European countries today. The international <b>workers' day</b>. Yesterday it was the Walpurgis Night which is an important celebration in Sweden.

						It's been some time - three days - that I posted something here. It seems that something always comes in between. Anyway, today we are off to Antwerp with the family to do some sight-seeing/city exploration all of us. It's something the city is arranging; a tour around the high-lights of the city with questions about what you see. If you complete the questioner form you have the chance of winning a price. Not sure what it is though, but that is not why we participate. At least not most of us...

						Just as a little side-note, I am exploring and comparing some new and existing CMS systems and what would be the best workflow/solution when developing and maintaining content of websites. An overall efficient workflow I value the highest. It's a very interesting topic and something that is constantly changing with the rapid development in that area. Especially now also with the ever so popular AI and ML technology popping up like mushrooms. Hugo, Grav, Netlify CMS are some of the products that I wanted to mention for now. I updated my Bookmark page with some interesting resources.
