						Today it is cold for the season, rainy and generally a grey day. I am enjoying some leftovers for lunch and soon I will have to drive J to the tram station. He has one of his very last exams (still one to go; French tomorrow which marks the end of the exam period for this time) today.

						We are home alone this evening, and we are planning a decadent dinner with meat, fries (served with a real pepper sauce) and wine. How is that saying, "when the cat's away, the mice will play". Maybe I will have a picture later...

It is always great to receive filaments; to see the colour in real life and imagine the projects that will match. But I also ordered a PEI heatbed plate for my Creality 3D printer. As you can see it is the original Creality gold plate kit. Meaning that it has the bottom part that glues stuck and then on the other side a magnetic coating on which the PEI plate rests on. This is a rather big thing on a printer having the old school glass plate.

						Another perfect Sunday, chores around the house but mainly it was to the the garden in order. My mission was getting the back-terrace tiles clean from "the slippery layer of bird evilness"<i class="fa-solid fa-poop fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #541612;"></i>. Yes the terrace is located under trees - below the meeting place of all the birds in the neighbourhood it seems. "yes, come and sit down right here next to me and take a dump my friend", is what the evil birds are telling each other. I can just hear them! Their friends are sitting in another tree above my car at the front of the house...
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was a nice day with a nice result after all the work in the garden. Nice and pretty and the terrace tiles are like new. It was planned to go to a restaurant, but we decided to have a cosy dinner at home since the youths have a very busy week, starting off with exams. It continues with celebrations, meeting up with friends and then they will work at a festival called&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.graspop.be/en/"> Graspop Metal Meeting</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">This is one of the bigger metal music festival, an old school rock event.

						OK, another busy weekend day that seemed to just have flew by. Kaboom, now I am sitting here on a Sunday night. Nicely tired, stiff back and ready for the bed.

						It was a great Saturday. We just didn't care about the strange weather - one minute is it like the rain is going to start any second and then the sun came out. Then extremely windy and then the rain did came, then back to sun again...you get the picture. We just didn't care and went out to continue getting the garden in order. We still had to finalize the hedges and clean up around the flowers and plants. I cut the lawn (everytime I use our lawnmover I am so impressed that it still work. Last time I had to clean the electric spools in the motor) and trimmed the edges and I also spent some time to improve the water pipe that goes from the water filter back into the pond. 
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The youths came together in the afternoon, J had to continue the studying but they joined us sporadicly in the garden now and then during their breaks. Fantastic times.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow we will have to continue some gardenwork (hopefully I can clean the 3-chamber water filter) and then in the evening we will have an night out with the youths in Antwerp when we drop them off at the apartment there.

						Friday at last. It is finally here, not a day too early. We are all together and J. has an evening free with his friends before the study weekend comences. H. and I are also finding our selfs in a state of blis. It is such a fantastic bunch of friends that he has. Just like I had, it will be depicting his life.

						It's been a busy work day, it seems I am writing that in every post, but today was really a busy day. It started at 07:30 and I had about 30 minutes break at 14:30 to have lunch (to eat and do some stuff around the house) and then it was right back at it. It continued until 17:00 when I had to start with the admin stuff to complete the week. Some strategic emails just had to go out. A crazy day, but there are no problem if I am doing meaningful things like today. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It doesn't mean that I have no time for the important things in life, one being 3D printing.

						A couple of busy days behind us, J with all the studying and exams which also means some logistical and coordination tasks for us, the parents. But this is something that we find being one of the perks of life and, I would even go so far to say that it is what I consider to be the meaning of life. At least it falls in that category. It has also been a rather busy time at work, mostly in a positive way with some interesting challenges.

						Yesterday was a great day when I managed to help out my father in law and H. in between calls who had taken on the project of trimming our hedge. It is a huge project and something that need coordination and takes a lot of time and effort to complete. It interesting that it was planned almost on the same day a year ago, but&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="/archive/index__jun2023.html#18jun2023">that was a day</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">Without knowing, we scheduled it almost exactly a year ago.</span></i>&nbsp; when we also were struggling with extreme weather.

						OK, an interesting day so far. The day started with calls scheduled to start at 8 in the morning and it continued the whole day until 5pm this evening. Meaning it the calls ended at 6 pm (except for a window of 30 minutes during lunch time). Without going into too many details at one point in the morning I had 4 calls at the same time... Of course you can not participate in all, then you have to prioritice. That's been the story the whole day. Not neccesary bad, just the reality.

						The air compressor was delivered in the week. Normally it was initially planned for 19th of June, but now I received it 14 days earlier.
