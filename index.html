						It was difficult to wake up today, luckily the first call was not that early. I have felt reluctant to drive to the office lately due to overwhelmingly much to do and also due to the extreme traffic situation lately. The other day I was driving to the car repair shop, which normally takes about 25 minutes. It took more than 2 hours and it felt like I had to drive through half of Belgium to get there. I do not mind the driving per se, it's more to be in time for calls (not all of them can be done in the car as I need access to the computer etc) and to be home in a decent time.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J had an exam today in supply chain and I really wonder how it went! Apparently the feeling was not that good (one mistake can have a huge impact), but to be expected as the preparation was limited (to say the least). Anyway, let's hope for the best...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I checked the open source version of ChatGPT (the very popular chat and language interpretation technology using artificial intelligence and machine learning) called Open Assistant. It's completely free and I have seen a YouTube clip and read an article about it which triggered my curiosity. The initial tests I did on the website shows a promising result but I have to try it some more.

						Just back from Antwerp. We have just seen M - the daughter of friends M and W - perform ballet. It was the yearly dance performance that the group arranges. Before the show we had dinner together, it was nice meeting them all and to see how good she is in dancing. Of course there are some who are painfully bad, but it certainly did not take away the experience and the positive atmosphere. J and K are not home yet, we expect them home any minute now. Now off to bed.

						No, I did not fall off the face of the earth. But so much is going on lately that it is difficult to keep track on priorities. It's all being processed as it comes... and of course not according to priorities in most cases. But that is to be expected I guess, when there are so many moving targets at the moment. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						"Moving targets" is a good word, it's really been forget everything and see how it plays out. Today we can finally have our own evening. J studied the whole day (more like 2 hours) for the exam tomorrow (he studied "supply chain" a couple of hours). It is fantastic to see talk with him about it, amazing how much he picks up in such a short time. I wonder if he understand that supply chain is what I have been working with for about 25 years... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was fantastic that I could do some drone flying today. I could explore how to take <i class="tooltipimg">pictures <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/fe/b4/znuVCiIj_o.jpg">This were one of the pictures that I took. Our Lilac is just about blooming and I was hovering in place to take this picture.</span></i> (once I discovered that the mini SD card needed to be inserted). Well, the flight was about 25 minutes (had already used some battery while discovering how to stream video to the network).
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Well anyway, feels like it is Friday already here but now it is time to go to bed. We had a lot happening the last couple of days (in a near future I might have some very special to share in silence). The day in Antwerp with family was very nice. One day I also had to go back to the garage where they fixed the car after the accident (I think I mentioned that they forgot to mount a panel under the hood). It should finally be OK now, but what about the quality control?
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						For now that has to be it. A lot is also going on at work, the travel to Dubai is one example that is still lingering on but should probably be fine. It is to be expected in such a huge project. Anyways, now it is time to go to bed for sure...

						It's been some time - three days - that I posted something here. It seems that something always comes in between. Anyway, today we are off to Antwerp with the family to do some sight-seeing/city exploration all of us. It's something the city is arranging; a tour around the high-lights of the city with questions about what you see. If you complete the questioner form you have the chance of winning a price. Not sure what it is though, but that is not why we participate. At least not most of us...

						Just as a little side-note, I am exploring and comparing some new and existing CMS systems and what would be the best workflow/solution when developing and maintaining content of websites. An overall efficient workflow I value the highest. It's a very interesting topic and something that is constantly changing with the rapid development in that area. Especially now also with the ever so popular AI and ML technology popping up like mushrooms. Hugo, Grav, Netlify CMS are some of the products that I wanted to mention for now. I updated my Bookmark page with some interesting resources.

						Again, there were some really heavy days at work <i class="fa-solid fa-user-tie fa-fade fa-lg"></i>. It comes and goes in waves this period - every year the same thing. It is either start-up of big projects or a lot of travels this time of the year. I can see the latter happening more again now post pandemic. I have two new big projects and one travel going on at the moment. The travelling I am sorting out, always a lot of effort and coordination involved (time and duration, flights, hotel arrangements, transportation, people, organizational, cost approvals, schedules ... )! But once done, it's really the perks of my job. Especially when there is a totally new destination on the horizon like this! But, in between the trip seems very far away. It might just stay at the horizon...we will see.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Our wonderful son has fled the scene, he and his friends left for Leuven to visit one of his friends who studies there. "Fled", I said because he receives the points from his exams today. The points have already been released, it is his parents that desperately are trying to see it. It seems we are the only one interested in it though.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Tomorrow is it Friday, end of a very rough week . Normally I was going to the office tomorrow, but seriously I actually have no time for it <i class="fa-regular fa-rectangle-list fa-lg"></i>.

					<p class="main">
						I leave this current post by mention yet another techie thing that I discovered yesterday, namely the solution on streaming directly from my DJI drone to a media device. I tried Nginx on a Raspberry Pi, but never really got it working (OBS kept disconnecting/reconnecting to the stream) so I turned back again to the MonaServer. I got it working in the end (just a matter of entering correct URI expression in the settings of the drone software.)

It's called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://vdo.ninja">VDO.Ninja</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This is a fantastic free tool that works great.

					<p class="main">
						I leave this current post by mention yet another techie thing that I discovered yesterday, namely the solution on streaming directly from my DJI drone to a media device. I tried Nginx on a Raspberry Pi, but never really got it working (OBS kept disconnecting/reconnecting to the stream) so I turned back again to the MonaServer. I got it working in the end (just a matter of entering correct URI expression in the settings of the drone software.)

That gives me some time to focus on specific chores (cleaning the pump in the pond, investigating car cleaning [more to come], writing and some 3D printing [more to come about this as well]).

						Of course - expect the the unexpectable - my initial plans for the day did not really match the reality. But that is to be expected, not surprised thus. Some things took  much longer and others set me off on side tracks. But these paths are sometimes the coolest tracks you can explore. That is how we learn and develop and today was a rare opportunity to let that happen.
					</p>

I am very happy with the result, and it worked perfectly! I also took the time to explore how I can stream the video recording directly from the drone. I explored the RTMP protocol with <b>Nginx</b> webserver and, a new webserver to me, the <b>Monaserver</b>. None of them really worked for different reasons. I turned to Youtube, but it takes 24 hours to activate the Stream service. I guess I just have to wait...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						It was not the opportunity to clean the car due to the bad weather, but I explored what can be done to clean it more efficient. Especially now with the upcoming season. With just one investment, I can really utilize what I already have - the high pressure cleaner. I decided to order a little additional gadget to hopefully make the cleaning processes more efficient.

It was just a strange vibe kind, the weather was completely chaotic - rain, sun, grey and cloudy and then back to rain again. It was just all over the place. That certainly contributed to the overall strangeness. Well, enough with the contemplating, it's time to chill...

						We even had a moment after the family gathering just the 4 of us before leaving for the airport, and guess where we went? That is right, back to the local little local airport where we live. We had a snack and drinks before it was time to go to Eindhoven.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						After a very nice time together we drove (92 km one way) to Eindhoven where they caught their flight to Valencia. They will spend the next wee k there and then return next weekend to Amsterdam (indeed, another airport). We, the parents, have already booked something in Amsterdam perfectly in time to pick them up. We have taken the opportunity to do a little excursion in the area before we pick up the kids! But that will be for another post...

					<p class="main">
						You can not believe what happened today in between everything else that happened. I bought my fantastic drone - the <b><i>DJI Mini 2 se</i></b>. It's such a fantastic cool little drone. I have done a seriously and thorough research about drones. I even have my official drone operator certificate and I have the diploma to prove it. Yes, Sire! I have already found loads of things that I can 3D print for it...

						Happy Easter! It was a very nice day today, the weather turned great in the afternoon and we even went to the local air field.

						Let's see if J is feeling better tomorrow (he will have a check-up at the doctor's since he is flying to Valencia on Sunday).

						Today a big - in the fully meaning of positiveness - day, first day of my mini-holiday. The weather to match, it was blue skies and full sun the whole day. The initial plan was to quickly going to get some garden chairs for the terrace and then get into heavy duty lawn work. What did I say about plans verses reality..? Indeed, it is never ever a match.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Go and get. In, out and home. Yeah, right... We got the chairs and why not pick the grey ones, we said. We got them for a great price compared to what we had seen. Great! We had to put them together, very easy, but still it always brings those IKEA emotions (no, these were not from IKEA) out. All done and we placed them out around the table, inspected them, and... no, it was just not it. Completely the wrong colour and it didn't go with any of the other stuff. What to do? Luckily we could change them (but it had to be today and we had to take them completely apart again and go there). This time we picked the black ones - the safe choice - looks great though. This time around I knew how to put them together and we worked as a well oiled machine together. What a team work! It really looks great. The work on the lawn will be for Friday... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Another thing happening today was that J's new mobile phone was delivered today. Looks really great actually. The work of transferring from the old one to the new is rather smoothly done these days. Especially if it is from one iPhone to another. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I am interested in buying a drone and doing some initial research about that. I think maybe that the DJI Trello can be too little and the battery time is only about 13 minutes. The idea is to have it to fly up and inspect the solar panels. At least 20 minutes of battery lifetime is needed and I need a really good camera. It has to be livestreaming camera to the controller/mobile phone since I have to fly where I can't see it and 15 meters up. The <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://store.dji.com/be/product/dji-mini-2-se?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuszb5dOT_gIVmMHVCh3oAAduEAAYASAAEgKBmvD_BwE&vid=132621&set_region=BE&from=store-nav">dji 2 mini SE</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This one seems to be perfect for my needs...

					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday was a busy but very nice day. After breakfast we drove J and K to the train station - they were going to spend a couple of days where she grew up. The area is known for amusement parks and carnivals. Once they were dropped of at the train station, H and I continued towards Brussels to go to the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.plantentuinmeise.be/en/">Meise Botanic Garden</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about the very nice Botanical garden on the homepage. A lot of interesting stuff to see - both inside in the huge greenhouse and outside in the immense garden.

It's the first time we visit the garden and meet S's boyfriend S - the company and the garden was great! The garden will be even nicer when the temperature is warmer.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We were back home again in the evening to a waiting nice homecooked dinner (fantastic leftover food - the kind that tastes even better the days after - from the day before). We were so ready for a cosy evening. J informed us that he, all of a sudden, started not to feel great - throat ache and generally not great. No matter how old your kids are getting, you will always have that feeling of how you want to take care of them. Especially if they are not close by. We certainly discussed the best approach on how he should tackle it...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Only having a 2-day workweek this week - I took some Easter <i class="fa-solid fa-egg fa-lg" style="color: #f5b60a;"></i> holiday to end the week. I even did the same for next week...fantastic!

						The weather got better and better during the day and both of us, H's been busy working in the garden the whole day, could prepare the garden for the season. It was a challenge to focus at work today, well actually not since a lot of stuff was going that I had to deal with. Once time allowed; the annual high-pressure cleaning <i class="fa-solid fa-broom fa-lg"></i> of the terrace commenced. It's such a satisfying thing to do as you see the result at once. I also did the garden furniture's and what ever I could aim the hose at...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Now we will enjoy a family TV evening with a home cooked meal together with J (who came home alone earlier today with the train) who's got a proper throat ache and feeling bad.

						I am enjoying the coffee tremendously today, the first day of April. I can appreciate the slow start today after the busy work week behind me. I can take the time to sit and fiddle with stuff and doing some research while sipping coffee to the nice music that is playing in the background.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday, the last day of March, ended very nice. Loads of stuff happened unplanned and the things that were planned changed or turned out differently. Very unpredicable, to say the least. After an eventful workday in the office in Brussels I drove home in crazy traffic. J arrived home with girlfriend K from being in Antwerp 2 days and one exam. They had a party to go to in the evening. Everything around kept changing (I spare you the details) and in the end the boys ended up here and the girls at someone elses place but met up later in the place they needed to be for the party. During the evening J's friends kept coming, my brother in law K suddenly arrived (we missed his SMS so he almost ended up in the veranda where the boys were sitting, thinking it was one of the friends arriving). It was very nice with the spontanous chat and a glass of wine. Much later than expected we could finally enjoy our homemade pasta.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						This morning we learned that the youth arrived around 3 in the morning, the oldies were already long time at sleep. Today we are all going to a family birthday party. Can be a very interesting, for sure very loud, evening. Night. Morning...
