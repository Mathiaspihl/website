						Finally the youths are home. They arrived around 16:45 after a long and tedious trip from the airport of Brussels - they missed the bus due to yet more delays and took the train to Antwerp and then the tram to Merksem where they were picked-up by a parent (yes, this time we were not available for once). The cancellation of the flight<i class="fa-solid fa-plane-slash fa-xl img-myicons"></i>put the whole group in an additional hotel night in Prague after a little bit of a "drama moment". Completely understandable if it is the first time it happens and also the timing was the worst possible as it is in the critical period of studying for upcoming exams.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Anyhow, I have endured the worst, at least I hope so, workday of the week. I had constantly conference calls today with only sporadic breaks. This while I know what the youths are going through without the possibilities that I can step in and help them. It surely added to my frustration. On top of that, I had some drastic news about organisational changes happening in the company. It could potentially have a direct impact for my team. Let's see what will come in our way...
					</p> 

					<p class="main">
						I think that is the biggest things happening, I am sure I forgot something that I wanted to share. Now I am looking forward to the dinner<i class="fa-solid fa-utensils fa-xl img-myicons"></i>that I started to prepare with the youths and H.

						For just a while ago we learned that J.'s and K.'s flight from Prague got cancelled! They were supposed to be home with us tonight around 22:00 o'clock. But, thus that is not going to happen. The flight was completely cancelled due to&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">technical reasons&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/4a/d6/8rttzVF1_o.png" alt="flight status">Here is the initial information I discovered some time before it was known by the group... note the time of the screenshot 18:13 o'clock.</span></span>. Now, they - all 9 (one of them had booked with another aviation company) of them - are looking for a hotel for the night and it seems they will enjoy another night in the area of the castle of Prague. Maybe not the most practical solution, but let's see how it goes... the benefit of a doubt, as they say.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						For us, the parents, we have prepared and done some stuff around the house. I even took some time to do some 3D printing today. I have investigated and printed replacements of bicycle valve caps for my father in law and also something (a surprise) to give to J. when he is back as a symbol on what to come. J. has now an extreme tight schedule to follow to study for his exams. The tight schedule is even tighter with the cancellation of the flight, he is loosing two days in reality.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						When we where in Stockholm it just happened by chance (really strange as well) that I found the shop called Brobergs. It is really a "gentlemen's" shop selling cigars and pipes (with all accessories). It just happened that I bought some pipe tobacco. I don't really know why, but it just kind of happened...and&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">here&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/8f/eb/rsr7qWZF_o.jpg" alt="peterson pipe tobacco">OK, so by chance I bought this one...</span></span>&nbsp;it is. It is really becoming a new hobby of mine. I love looking up new pipes and tobacco, the philosophy of pipe smoking is something that really attract me. Am I getting old? Well, I feel that it is something that really is me.
					</p> 

					<p class="main">
						We also have enjoyed some unpretentious, mini excursion on Sunday. You have to see it as a micro-, even macro-, holiday. Even if it is a walk in your garden, it can be a mental holiday... Once you do not see the magic in the little you have serious problems. Take your spouse and the loved ones by the hand and guide them out in the magic of nature. Once that stops your life is over. No question. In our case, we were invited for a breakfast in the castle of Rivierenhof by my parents in law. The walk in the park after the breakfast was mentally transformed into a little macro holiday which is exactly what was needed before the busy work week.

						We arrived back from the Sweden trip, I worked two days (Thursday and Friday of last week) and the youths already left on another trip to Prague. The month of July passed by so quickly, it is already August. I am pretty sure the fantastic holiday we had has something to do with it.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						With the delayed flight from Sweden, we only arrived home very late, we finally crawled in bed at around 02:00 on Thursday morning. I was working a few hours later... On Friday morning we had to get up at 03:40 to drive the youths to the airport in Eindhoven. Luckily it  went very smooth without any issues to speak of. Other than the fact that we were all very tired...obviously. We have had the first update from them that all the friends - all 10 of them - arrived to the destination safe and sound.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						We have been busy unpacking, cleaning and doing the practical things that must be done when returning home after being away. Not always the most fun things to do, it is like coming back to work from holiday and having to deal with all the emails etc. One of the things I did was off-loading all the pictures from the phone, you then see the pictures and remember back to the times and places they were taken. We have done so many nice things but it feels like ages ago... I will share some pictures to give you an idea about the times on the fantastic island of Madeira and the great times we had in Sweden. Here is the first, showing <span class="tooltipimg">the beautiful little cottage&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/61/d4/zFZmBXgO_o.jpg" alt="madeira calhau holiday">This is the cottage called calhau grande (it means "big rock") where we stayed. Note the fantasttic terrace; all the flowers and the colours in the garden. It was great coming out on the terrace every morning enjoying the coffee and the spectacular views.</span></span>&nbsp;where we stayed in Madeira. I will for sure contemplate many times back on this holiday! More to come, be sure!

						Something on a more technical, IT related level I thought I would share with you, is that I am testing a new browser. It has been around for a while for MacOS (with MacOS version dependency) but it was recently released for Windows as well. The web browser called&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://arc.net">Arc Browser</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">Read more about this new fascinating webbrowser here.</span></i>&nbsp;by the company called "The Browser Company". Yes, that is really the name of the company. So far - I only installed it yesterday - it looks very interesting and promising as I am more for the minimalistic and streamlined approach. Another web browser that I am using - mostly on Linux (it is actually my default browser on my Linux Mint, Cinnamon installation) - is the streamlined <i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://thorium.rocks/">Thorium Browser</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">My default browser on my Linux machine.</span></i>.

						It was a really long trip, not so much in distance nor in time, but it just felt like an extremely long trip, when we finally arrived in Äppelviken, Sweden. But, after all, it went fine.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Just to give an idea; after a whole day of working (last hours before holiday is always madness), we drove to Amsterdam airport. We were stuck for 40 minutes in traffic due to a terrible accident. Luckily we had planned with some margin. Then in the airport, all restaurants closed at 21:00 o'clock which is just unbelievable that an international airport do not offer decent meals in the evening. The choices are already limited to start with. But then again, The Netherlands is not a culinarian country. The flight was fine and the seats and service with SAS is not to be compared with those other "cheap money saving" airlines. We landed 00:15 (15 minutes in on 25th of July) and  receiving the checked-in luggage went smooth as well. We had a little bit of searching before we found the bus that would take us to the car rental area. Positively surprised about the car model, fits us just perfectly for our needs. It's the first time that I rent from Europcar, I have always used Hertz, so that was a new experience. I am now a privileged customer. <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-tongue-wink fa-xl"></i>

					<p class="main">
						Yesterday was our first day in Stockholm. We were all very tired, but we enjoyed it to the full. It was such a great day being back in Stockholm. Probably the most beautiful city in the world...

						Has it been that long? Yes, more than 2 weeks passed since last update around here. But it's been a holiday in between without a real possibility of updating. I could have done it (via the iPad and the GITHub compatible remote connection app that I have installed for the very same purpose. I used that same app to keep the site updated last year when we travelled to Greece). I guess it was being lazy and taking the opportunity of completely enjoying the holiday. Madeira and the location where we where is absolutely fantastic. <i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arco_da_Calheta">Arco da Calheta</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">This is truly a magic place.</span></i>&nbsp;(west of Funchal) and the surroundings is simply a magic place! I took hundreds of pictures, so expect more to come.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I am writing a quick update here today just before our next travel - holiday number two. This year we have the luxury of two travels - Madeira and Sweden - both happening in July. We are taking the flight from Schiphol (Amsterdam airport) again, pretty much same procedure as last time concerning those arrangements. I prefer Schiphol to Zaventem (Brussels) airport. Then in Sweden, we will be staying in Bromma after some hassle during the Airbnb booking. We also rented a car for the period that we are in Sweden. After some research, it is the most cost efficient arrangements if we take everything in consideration that we want to do.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, now I am finishing up at work as much as possible, finalize the packing, charging the car and then we will soon take off.

						It is Sunday and again the weekend is just flying by. The general plan is to get everything ready for the holiday. A lot still need to happen and to be finalized. When we are back from&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.calhaugrande.com/">holiday number one</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">Calhau Grande (the Calhau cottage) is where we will stay in Madeira.Read more about it here, their story and philosophy is really interesting.</span></i>, We will be home just a few days before we're travelling again which means that we have to finalize as much as possible for holiday number two as well.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J. and K. are here and are also included, if only in the periphery, in the plans of things to do. They have just come together after some individual activities. Funny, because it is really showing the differences between teenage boys and girls. Do I need to spell it out who spend the last couple of days working, thinking about the budget for upcoming costs needed expenses that might come when travelling etc. The other person prioritized to meet with friends, try out golf and chilling. Guess who did what...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Let's see if I get some time for more updates before we leave, but I plan to bring a laptop with me if possible. It is always practical to have the option to search internet and do some lookups about the place when Wifi connection is a rule rather than exception.

						OK, so the workweek is done. It is now history. Over and done with. So it's been a full week full of interesting, fun and annoying things happening.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Tuesday was fantastic exciting, J. had&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">his performance&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/45/fc/xaH4mXr2_o.jpg" alt="performance guitar music">It was an absolutely crazy great performance. Parents insanely proud! Note the photagrapher below the stage on the left... a proper performar! The whole night, such a friendly and inspiring night with friends and random friendly people turning up and showing their support.</span></span>&nbsp;in Lier. The parents were probably more nervous that the person who would actually perform. After some clarifications and messaging H. and I strategically decided just to turn up at the performance more or less unplanned. At a VERY particular and timely time. It turned out to be a fantastic night, we drove a friend back and only arrived at home around midnight. But so, so worth it!
						
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						H. had a insanely crazy busy week. Always the last week before they close down before the summer break it is pure craziness! Then, guess what happens, I receive a message that the Airbnb apartment in Sweden will not be available for us. An apartment that was booked and confirmed already. It's a very long and annoying story, but it comes down to that we, the four of us, had no where to stay for the booked trip to Stockholm in 20 days... After some stressful days we found an apartment that was still available. It is not easy to find something in the area we like (and for the purpose of the trip) for the time already booked. "Long story short", it turned out great. Seems that we found an even better apartment after the ordeal of having to go into the nitty-gritty details in all available options. Now we are in the very nice are of Äppelviken in Bromma. Even closer to my brother! It turned out all good, but what an annoying thing we had to deal with on-top of everything else...
						
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						OK, and then we are Friday. Today thus. I had an garage appointment to change into summer tires. I know, embarrassing late. Due to circumstances, that is just how it is. I was extremely lucky with traffic (the garage appointment was strategically booked and it paid off). As I was one hour earlier and managed to get that slot, I was home again at the time of my original garage appointment. I have  a long history with them and I personally know the manage there - thanks D. - as for some 15 years or so I have been a customer there. That means, when I have my summer tires on, it is officially summer. It is perfect in time, H. is now also officially on the summer holiday. I still have next Monday to go....then we are off to Madeira!

						The work-week started after the fully planned weekend that was. It was busy weekend in a laid back way, I think describes the weekend the best. Today the coffee tasted especially good. Greatness in a mug...

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I just left off in the last post about meeting up with friends for the planned Escape room and dinner evening. H. and I parked the car in Antwerp and met up with friends M. and B. for a quick drink. Then we went to the Escape room which is called&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://kraakfabriek.be/EN/index.html#Escape-Rooms">Kraakfabriek</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">The Kraakfabriek in Antwerp is the best of Escape rooms so far.

						We were invite to J's girlfriend's parent home for her birthday. She'd planned out her birthday party to the tiniest detail. We met and socialist with the family properly for the first time. We met with family members and the relatives and had a very nice time. We were back again at around 22 o'clock after the hour drive it takes.
