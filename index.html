						It was a great Easter celebration today. J and K stayed over and this morning we were invited to a brunch at parents in law and we could all experience the nice food and company. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We even had a moment after the family gathering just the 4 of us before leaving for the airport, and guess where we went? That is right, back to the local little local airport where we live. We had a snack and drinks before it was time to go to Eindhoven.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						After a very nice time together we drove (92 km one way) to Eindhoven where they caught their flight to Valencia. They will spend the next wee k there and then return next weekend to Amsterdam (indeed, another airport). We, the parents, have already booked something in Amsterdam perfectly in time to pick them up. We have taken the opportunity to do a little excursion in the area before we pick up the kids! But that will be for another post...

					<p class="main">
						You can not believe what happened today in between everything else that happened. I bought my fantastic drone - the <b><i>DJI Mini 2 se</i></b>. It's such a fantastic cool little drone. I have done a seriously and thorough research about drones. I even have my official drone operator certificate and I have the diploma to prove it. Yes, Sire! I have already found loads of things that I can 3D print for it...

						Today a big - in the fully meaning of positiveness - day, first day of my mini-holiday. The weather to match, it was blue skies and full sun the whole day. The initial plan was to quickly going to get some garden chairs for the terrace and then get into heavy duty lawn work. What did I say about plans verses reality..? Indeed, it is never ever a match.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Go and get. In, out and home. Yeah, right... We got the chairs and why not pick the grey ones, we said. We got them for a great price compared to what we had seen. Great! We had to put them together, very easy, but still it always brings those IKEA emotions (no, these were not from IKEA) out. All done and we placed them out around the table, inspected them, and... no, it was just not it. Completely the wrong colour and it didn't go with any of the other stuff. What to do? Luckily we could change them (but it had to be today and we had to take them completely apart again and go there). This time we picked the black ones - the safe choice - looks great though. This time around I knew how to put them together and we worked as a well oiled machine together. What a team work! It really looks great. The work on the lawn will be for Friday... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Another thing happening today was that J's new mobile phone was delivered today. Looks really great actually. The work of transferring from the old one to the new is rather smoothly done these days. Especially if it is from one iPhone to another. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I am interested in buying a drone and doing some initial research about that. I think maybe that the DJI Trello can be too little and the battery time is only about 13 minutes. The idea is to have it to fly up and inspect the solar panels. At least 20 minutes of battery lifetime is needed and I need a really good camera. It has to be livestreaming camera to the controller/mobile phone since I have to fly where I can't see it and 15 meters up. The <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://store.dji.com/be/product/dji-mini-2-se?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuszb5dOT_gIVmMHVCh3oAAduEAAYASAAEgKBmvD_BwE&vid=132621&set_region=BE&from=store-nav">dji 2 mini SE</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This one seems to be perfect for my needs... It is also below the critical 250 g which is the limit of what you can fly without any permits etc.</span></i> or possibly <i>dji mini SE</i> is probably perfect for that.

						A short workweek started with cold (all the cars on the street outside were covered with a white layer of frost) weather but sunny and blue skies.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday was a busy but very nice day. After breakfast we drove J and K to the train station - they were going to spend a couple of days where she grew up. The area is known for amusement parks and carnivals. Once they were dropped of at the train station, H and I continued towards Brussels to go to the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.plantentuinmeise.be/en/">Meise Botanic Garden</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about the very nice Botanical garden on the homepage. A lot of interesting stuff to see - both inside in the huge greenhouse and outside in the immense garden. I can really recommend it!</span></i> We met up with friend S - also J's god mother - and her boyfriend S. It's the first time we visit the garden and meet S's boyfriend S - the company and the garden was great! The garden will be even nicer when the temperature is warmer.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We were back home again in the evening to a waiting nice homecooked dinner (fantastic leftover food - the kind that tastes even better the days after - from the day before). We were so ready for a cosy evening. J informed us that he, all of a sudden, started not to feel great - throat ache and generally not great. No matter how old your kids are getting, you will always have that feeling of how you want to take care of them. Especially if they are not close by. We certainly discussed the best approach on how he should tackle it...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Only having a 2-day workweek this week - I took some Easter <i class="fa-solid fa-egg fa-lg" style="color: #f5b60a;"></i> holiday to end the week. I even did the same for next week...fantastic!

						The weather got better and better during the day and both of us, H's been busy working in the garden the whole day, could prepare the garden for the season. It was a challenge to focus at work today, well actually not since a lot of stuff was going that I had to deal with. Once time allowed; the annual high-pressure cleaning <i class="fa-solid fa-broom fa-lg"></i> of the terrace commenced. It's such a satisfying thing to do as you see the result at once. I also did the garden furniture's and what ever I could aim the hose at...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Now we will enjoy a family TV evening with a home cooked meal together with J (who came home alone earlier today with the train) who's got a proper throat ache and feeling bad.

						OK, I did not do an update yesterday as planned, the last day of March. I'll come back to that soon. Today it's already the 1st of April and I have to make a monthly update soon - I reckon this post will live both on the March- and as well in the April pages.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I am enjoying the coffee tremendously today, the first day of April. I can appreciate the slow start today after the busy work week behind me. I can take the time to sit and fiddle with stuff and doing some research while sipping coffee to the nice music that is playing in the background.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday, the last day of March, ended very nice. Loads of stuff happened unplanned and the things that were planned changed or turned out differently. Very unpredicable, to say the least. After an eventful workday in the office in Brussels I drove home in crazy traffic. J arrived home with girlfriend K from being in Antwerp 2 days and one exam. They had a party to go to in the evening. Everything around kept changing (I spare you the details) and in the end the boys ended up here and the girls at someone elses place but met up later in the place they needed to be for the party. During the evening J's friends kept coming, my brother in law K suddenly arrived (we missed his SMS so he almost ended up in the veranda where the boys were sitting, thinking it was one of the friends arriving). It was very nice with the spontanous chat and a glass of wine. Much later than expected we could finally enjoy our homemade pasta.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						This morning we learned that the youth arrived around 3 in the morning, the oldies were already long time at sleep. Today we are all going to a family birthday party. Can be a very interesting, for sure very loud, evening. Night. Morning...
