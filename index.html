						Wednesday and we have only reached middle of the week, it feels like so much happened already. I could swear it was Friday when I woke up this morning... Interesting orders delivered and tried out (one example was the SCART to HDMI converter solution for someone in our neighbourhood), guiding J. during his time starting up and getting into the new routines. I also went to an event with the masons who hosted an interesting presentation. today I could enjoy a fantastic lunch outside in the sun and soon we will have a dinner with J before he leaves for Antwerp again. It was fabulous to meet and connect with him, even for a few hours.  What will the rest of the week bring?
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						In one of the Youtube videos I watched today one stood out, I especially noticed the PDF solution (more like a PDF framework) called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.stirlingtools.com/docs/Overview/What%20is%20Stirling-PDF">Stirling-PDF</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it here on the website of Stirling-PDF. It's a product with some bugs and still very much under development.</span></i>. I also continued checking different Hugo solutions and themes. Very interesting!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Now we have just had dinner - home made burgers <i class="fa-solid fa-burger fa-xl" style="color: #9c6b02;"></i> - and we enjoyed the talks with our son. Times like these are moments to treasure! J. is preparing to go back to Antwerp again.

						As a techie side note I can mention that I have intensified the usage and research on Hugo - the brilliant <i>Static Site Generator</i> system <i class="fa-solid fa-code fa-xl"></i>.

						J. is busy with his "university life" in Antwerp, he went there yesterday and will stay until Wednesday when he will come home for a short while. He might stay the night then. I know that there is a party on Thursday that he will attend, it is "the week of the student" so there are a lot of festivities happening this week.

						It was the yearly air show this weekend and we picked the perfect day as yesterday was a grey and rainy day, it was a beautiful day.

						J. is on his way home... hopefully soon. We have to pick him up at the train station in Berchem just because he is much later than what was initially planned. It is not easy to be in the middle and try to do the right thing for everyone at that age. The insight, the limited experience and planning skills of a teenager...

						On the 3D printing side of things, there have been some interesting news - Input Shaping is coming not only to MK4, but also to my little Mini+ machine. I am so excited about that. It's a complete new technology that was actually used by the Kipper firmware (if we can call it Firmware) first. It is basically a smarter way of calculating acceleration and stopping movements of the printer-header. As a comparison, a 3D print that normally takes around 1,5 hour can complete in 16 minutes.

						A bit of moaning and nagging time... but what a day it was. Nothing serious at all of course, this is just to vent something. Today was the one long call that I had to attend to - it's worse to attend a remote call opposed to travel there and be in the meeting onsite. Attending a remote meeting like this, in this format, you have to be there, follow the same schedule and always be ready for any question or input. 2 hours is OK, but 7 hours <i class="fa-regular fa-face-tired fa-xl"></i> like it was today, is just much too long! I was already tired before it started... A LOT of coffee was needed! But all went fine so no real complaints.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J arrived home today, he's finally home after the intense school start that began right after his cosy and intimate holiday. The new term begins, new routines and a lot for him to take in. I picked him up at the tram station and enjoyed the drive home in his presence again with stories and sharing thoughts between us <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-hearts fa-xl" style="color: #c83d0e;"></i>. But then, a bit frustrating, it was straight back into the call again. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						There were some other "oddities" happening during my marathon call - receiving of orders and email messages stating that I still have a rental car in my possession <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grimace fa-beat fa-xl"></i>...etc. that I need to urgently deal with at the same time. A normal day thus. <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-tongue-wink fa-xl"></i>

						It was a work week that started off this morning hitting the ground running. It was all in at once and it continued the whole morning like that.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was also a new start for J with the start of the new term starting. He's been communicating with us today, all sorts of immediate worries and confirmations needed. It is such a perk for me being a parent to such a wonderful son. Oh, that sounded so, but utterly cliché but it is truly the meaning of life. I have written about it before, but that is REALLY the meaning of life - to make your children a better version of yourself. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was a weird morning waking up, first I could not fall a sleep the night before (probably around 2am:ish) and then I woke up at 6am due to someone's early schedule and I could easily go back to bed again. But did it happen, absolutely not. All sorts of "important" thoughts kept my brain busy! Anyways, maybe magic (that I fall asleep) happens tonight...?
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, we have to find a nice movie to watch. The one called "Ticket to paradise" we started to watch yesterday was really shit, even though George Clooney and Julia Roberts were in it. J stays in Antwerp tonight and then it's an early morning for him tomorrow. Generally he's got a different schedule than last term. More school related items to plan for him as well as being able to combine it with his girl friend, his friends and other important things in his life. He is growing up. Yes, we all know how it was... But, the different is that it is completely different in every generation. With that, it is time for our dinner...

						The youth are back safe from their "Morocco trip" (due to the earthquake the plans got drastically changed) since yesterday night. We went and got them at the airport in Eindhoven yesterday from their return flight from Italy - they have explore Venice the last couple of days. When we drove J to the airport last week, it was a thick mist that made the drive there not very enjoyable. Luckily the driving assistant in the Polestar helped me out. Last night, it was again a stressful drive but this time it was due to thunderstorms and extreme rain fall. It all turned out great, we were in time, the kids were back in one piece and it was a pleasant drive back. Glad to have them back, nice to have them around again. <i class="fa-solid fa-hands-holding-child fa-beat fa-xl"></i>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Except from that I went to the office on Friday, was it a rather ordinary working week. Some interesting work related activities are coming up next week with a customer QBR taking place in Munich (I will join remotely due to other ongoing activities). Another interesting thing is that I am coming into a new phase in one of my long-running projects. Very interesting and, due to recent developments, it will mark a very important milestone. I just hope that it goes according to plan.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I also did an interesting 3D print - <i class="tooltipimg">a Velcro-like objects <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/56/4b/wgXCDkQQ_o.jpg">Very interesting 3D-print object - I just had to try it out.

I made a test and 3D printed two sets of them and  used glue (the good stuff that really works) on one of my earlier test prints - the very first test-3D-print with the Prusa machine - and stuck it to a wall mounted object.

						Going back some time to when we drove back from Eindhoven airport - I like that airport very much, I flew to Munich and Sofia a couple of times from there - with mixed feelings. J. was leaving for Milano that morning, but then they were leaving for Marrakech the following day. It was a weird feeling sitting in the car and J. expressed it as well when were all in the car at 05:30 in the morning. Not a very good feeling thus! It was a heart-warming goodbye at "kiss & ride" parking area - multiple close hugs from our son. We drove back in an almost <i class="tooltipimg">magical mist <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/a7/a5/0bGje3ou_o.jpg">The drive back was almost magical and surreal... You can not see longer than 50 meters, beyond this view there are fields and farm houses.</span></i> with thousands of thoughts flowing through the brain. Anyway, we are getting a lot of love and correspndence from J. and K. from Venice - they have found an intresting location for the restof their holiday as an alternative. They are the cutest <i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-beat fa-xl" style="color: #f50000;"></i> couple you can imagine!

						I had the first service appointment booked for my car - the fantastic Polestar 2 - today. Luckily we have an official Volvo dealer who also supports Polestar in Brasschaat. It make life easy for me, I had to drive 10 minutes to get there and, AND it is 20 meters (Ford is in the same room) from my H. is with her Ford car. "I kid you not", the VIP treatment she gets, flows over to me. It must, because I had an absolute fantastic experience with Scancar Brasschaat. A certain leasing company ("don't mention the war") is making life more difficult and Scancar is making the customer experience much better! I had a little car (the <i class="tooltipimg">tiny Toyota <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/9d/8a/xfbsZpkE_o.jpg">A charming little car...</span></i> car that I actually liked very much for the couple of hours that I had it) replacement car. The person I spoke with at Volvo Scancar confirmed my experience that the certain leasing company is note making the customer experience any easier with the additional complexities...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Specifically talking about the service of my car - a lot of checks and fixes were done. But doing the software upgrade is just as interesting. I had to do an upgrade of the software version 2.4 to 2.11 and that is a lot! It gives a complete new set of new enhancements, bug fixes and functions. You can have an idea <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.polestar.com/us/manual/polestar-2/2022/article/softwareUpdates/">here</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">More interesting reading about the updates here - check out what's new from 2.4 to 2.11, a lot of interesting stuff...</span></i>.

						Except arranging the car today, I could also take some time for myself to escape to a park for a quick walk around the pond. It's a nice walk perfect to have a break, breath and do some thinking. Always in my life I was close to nature for a quick break, to do some breathing and a quick walk to do some "earthing"!

						There have been some very unusual days the last two days; the earthquake in Morocco (J and girlfriend K were on their way there) and everything else that is going on. As I have repeated many times here, if one thing happens you can bet all your money on that there are at least 2 other interrelated tings coming at the same moment. And of course it will come completely out of the blue... That is my very own Murphy's law version 2.0. and I will have the patent on it with this.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						To start off with, we are without our son - he is FINALLY enjoying holiday in Italy at the moment. Today still Milano, tomorrow they are travelling to Venice. They had to make drastic changes to their plans. They were traveling to Marrakesh when an earthquake hit the country, dramatically changing those plans. The last day was very intense and, of course according to my pimped Murphy's law, we had a birthday party to go to as well. Let me just say that we were all in close contact with our son during the intense times of planning the rest of their holiday. His parents were so relieved - H and me thus - that "they decided" to stay in Italy and continue their holiday there.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Today was a great day with a lot of nice chores around the house that we completed. For me is one of the most satisfying feeling is to complete the work in the house and in the garden. It gives almost as good feeling as when I have a solution at work. I guess that proves that the balance is right! Even putting up pictures on the wall (way too many nails in the walls) is nice.

						Yes, you guessed it, the weather was yet again crazy warm today. A day like today it feels especially as a burden, I tell you why directly. Now I know how Jesus must have felt when he carried the cross <i class="fa-solid fa-cross fa-xl"></i> to a certain crucifixion. OK, that was maybe a slight exaggeration...but here it goes. So, I told you yesterday about that we were on our way to the dinner with my parents in law. It was great, super nice food and a cosy atmosphere. 
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We arrived home and did some planning work <i class="fa-regular fa-clock fa-xl" style="color: #00348f;"></i> for J and the inscription for next term. It's unbelievable how much they have to take into consideration for next year, all the subjects, projects and also they have the internship to plan abroad. They have to do two internship abroad during the program. In the second term they have the chance to go for the first time, it is however a strategic plan that they have to make with the very weird point system they have here. J is in constant communication with his "study colleagues" (he has such good connection with them that some of them even have been accepted by his core friends) at this point in time. They all agree that it is all so abstract. They had to complete and submit the complete plan before 20:00 yesterday. We were only back from the dinner at around 22:00 yesterday.... No one had submitted it yet. Somehow we completed the complete plan - taking a lot into consideration (girlfriend, friends, amount of points, interest... etc) - and submitted it. It seemed to be OK (I think all had to do because of his previous communication with the professors).
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was at this point in time that H started to feel "weird", and she said, "I better go to bed". I really thought that was strange. Overreaction? It drastically turned for the worse. H. had such pains that she almost fainted. She could hardly walk and J. first voiced the concerns that we better go to the hospital, to ER thus. And that is what we did, we dragged her into the car and went to the ER...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was acute food poisoning <i class="fa-solid fa-bugs fa-xl" style="color: #e20303;"></i>. The seafood she had - according to some research we did - had probably too much of the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568988323000148">harmful algae's</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Here is ONE of the many articles in the subject of harmful algae's I read...</span></i>. There were intense couple of hours that followed, to say the least. We were back at 2am  and asleep again about an hour later. Luckily, I had my conference call at 9am with my team next morning. I briefed them about the events of the previous night and we all could share similar stories about food poisoning (spanning from how the situation is today with everything coming from China, how the situation is these days in Europe and our view on the situation. Always very interesting!). 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, that was a lot of reading and it didn't even include the details, just the bare minimum. Tomorrow J. is starts the travel to Morocco and Marrakesh. The flight to Milano is tomorrow at around 9am tomorrow from Eindhoven <i class="fa-solid fa-plane-departure fa-xl" style="color: #4b4c4e;"></i>. It's about 1.5 hours away from where we live and he needs to be 2 hours before boarding... do the math! It will be an early morning tomorrow <i class="fa-brands fa-earlybirds fa-xl" style="color: #569964;"></i>. He will meet up his girlfriend there and then they travel the next day to their final destination. Anyways, I am off to bed now...

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We were invited to restaurant by the parents in law to socialise of course but also celebrate J's study result a little bit.

						I took some time for one of my Raspberry Pi computer - it needed to be taken care of. Since it is so hot indoor, I thought of checking the temperature of one of my main Raspberry Pi which, amongst much more, has the surveillance camera connected to it. I almost got a chock when I discovered it was at 73 C degrees! I started looking through my stash of Raspberry Pi things. Luckily, I found a fan and a heat-sink. I even installed a better network cable which allowed me to adjusted to a better position (away from direct sun-light and not in plain sight). Once the hardware and software was installed I could finally run a check and I was very happy with the result - I decreased the temperature by almost 30%. And I could use stuff that I already had laying around - very satisfying!

						Saturday and today, a spectacular Sunday, passed by too fast. Strange how holidays and weekends follows another time zone. Another way of counting the time, a little bit like dog-years - 1/7th of a normal year. It feels like an hour in the weekend is like 7 hours in real life in the weekend thus...

						So, J had a guitar performance to do today which he has been preparing for in his very own way - extremely privately and has only expressed his concerns very "sporadically" way. It is probably (read it: it is.) something bigger for him than for most people as he wants it to be perfect for his friend! He also never likes to be in the centre of attention. As his father, sorry for that... With that; it was great when he called us to let us know that it went perfectly. He had enjoyed it and played all his 6 melodies flawlessly! As a father, that still give the greatest feeling! Holy f..king crap how great that feels. That feeling turns shit into gold any time.

						OK, the first day of September is done. At least the working day is done and the evening and weekend started. We are enjoying the glasses of wine and, finally after the school start, being able to exhale...
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I have just concluded the extremely annoying task of trying to setup a local wifi hotspot on the Windows desktop computer here. It demands a lot of "hacky actions" to get the Windows home edition setup to allow it. I have different responses every time. Frustrating and something I did NOT want to spend more than 20 minutes on. Now I am 2 hours further.... Like my old boss used to say, "in my next life there will be no computers". He, sadly, passed away a long time ago but I agree with him 100%!
					</p>
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I think I broke the record of the number of calls I ever had during one working day. I lost count at 7 scheduled calls, there were some more in between. Not sure why it all happened today... but, you know what <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on Wikipedia. "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong".</span></i> said.

						Yesterday we finished the <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1464335/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">movie called "Uncharted"</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on IMDB. I like Tom as an actor... Also, this is a very emotional production as it was a game on Playstation that I started playing with J. I think we first started about 10 years ago on the first Playstation we had... magic moments!</span></i> Netflix movie that we only watched with J. It is not often we have the evenings free to enjoy the moment with J. But it was a great time yesterday. Egoistically speaking.
