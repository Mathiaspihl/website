						Yesterday was a fantastic evening. We decided to go to a restaurant with the youth. Again it was time for J. with another exam, it was time for the dreaded law exam. Finally, we decided to go into Antwerp and find the restaurant there. Lucky us because we found a great location, suggested by the youth, in the city center.

						What a fantastic Sunday it was! The whole weekend was great, but Sunday was really <i>the icing on the cake</i>. It started with a nice relaxed morning, then we - father in law G. and brother in law K. - headed into Antwerp and&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">the venue<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg">&nbsp;</i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://www.deroma.be/imagecache/generated/p/praktischzaal1.jpg/module/pages/large/praktischzaal1.jpg" alt="de roma venue antwerp">It's a very beautiful and intimate venue.</span></span>&nbsp;<i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Roma">De Roma </a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about this beautiful and historically important venue on Wikipeida.</span></i>&nbsp;for a concert.

					</p> 
 
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The Monday started as a typical start of a work week. The only thing is that it will be the last couple of days before I go on holiday for a week. You can not imagine how much I am looking forward to a week off. In the evening we were invited to friends for dinner to celebrate St Patrick's day. Yes, normally it is on the 17th of March, but this was the only day that everyone were available. It was a very nice evening with friends!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Today started early - it felt VERY early - with calls and specific work related activities. So far so good though with some interesting developments. It feels like it will be difficult to remember everything I have to do before I can leave for holiday. Oh, that reminds me...
					</p>
				
					<p class="main">
						Also to mention something about the latest in my 3D printing universe <i style="font-size:x-large;" class="nf nf-md-printer_3d_nozzle"></i>, I received the filament dryer box&nbsp;<i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.esun3d.com/ebox_lite-product/">the eSun ebox Lite</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">This is the one on the eSun product page.</span></i> which I already tried out.

						Yeah so the work week started and it was basically a normal (what is normal though) week. It was pretty busy, but nothing out of the extraordinary. Luckily there is coffee!
					</p> 
 
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J. has been sick the last couple of days. Is it Covid-19 or a serious cold, not sure. I suspect that it is Covid though. I wanted to give a comment about it here because it is just like taking care of "my little baby" again. It doesn't matter that he is 20 years old and it is probably the same experience for people around me when I am sick <i class="fa-regular fa-face-surprise fa-shake fa-xl"></i>. The serious state is called "man-flu". <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-squint-tears fa-xl"></i> No, but seriously, it is a lot of added logistics and of course it comes during the time of exams. Why doesn't it come in a non-critical period? I can tell you, it is due to that awful person called Murphy... Yes, Murphy's law! 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						More over, we bought some grass seeds for the lawn (and in the meantime it was also planted), the sun was back and on Wednesday we could enjoy it in the garden during lunch-time. It was fantastic. You can hear the birds coming back to our garden, see all the green coming back and get that sense of that Spring is knocking at the door. The bear is slowly waking up in his den...

						OK, 5 days already passed since last update. Almost a week passed, that is complete madness. Let me think back on what happened in a nutshell. But for that I need a nice strong coffee...  <i class="fa-solid fa-mug-hot fa-xl"></i>

						Last Friday J. and K. went to a party, it was in the Hilton hotel ballroom in Antwerp. Nice location, but not very well organised from what the youths told me. Maybe not the best event to do (especially if you stay until 04:00 in the morning) before a study weekend... On Saturday we went to friends - friend K. and K. - for dinner in <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechelen">Mechelen</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on Wikipedia.</span></i>. We saw their new house they bought and recently moved into. It is a really nice looking town house, a good location just next to the canal and close to a park. While we were enjoying the evening in Mechelen the youth were babysitting - luckily for them that the kids they were watching behaved extremely well. Sunday was a day to rest and recover. I think we all needed it after the last couple of days' events...

						I have recently been looking into how I best migrate from Netlify to Cloudflare? While I was doing the research I came across an article that explained the process, but also highlighted the reason what gave him the idea. Due to the concern sparked from recent news how Netlify charged a user for heavy bandwidth usage. Apparently the poor guy had been under a DDoS attack that caused heavy bandwidth usage which he had to pay the costs for. The bill was on a whopping $104k. It was then reduced to "only" $5k, still a huge bill for a free service! Anyways, I was going over the pros and cons for a possible move to Cloudflare. As far as I can see, migrating this site makes a lot of sense. My site <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://iamprinting.xyz">iamprinting.xyz</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Check this fantastic site out.</span></i> is already living there and likes it very much... <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-tongue-squint fa-shake fa-xl"></i>

						It feels like the work week just started but in fact it is already Wednesday. We are already halfway. A sign that it goes too fast is that both of us just forgot that our cleaning lady A. was coming yesterday. Guess my surprise when the doorbell rang and she was there... We had completely forgotten about it. It is probably due to the fact that it's been too much going on lately. Or is it a sign of age maybe? <i class="fa-regular fa-face-surprise fa-xl"></i>

						Something that I certainly did not forget was the doctor's appointment yesterday <i class="fa-solid fa-stethoscope fa-xl"></i>. It's just the annual check-up, even though it was 2 years ago that I last went. The blood pressure was taken and the doctor also took some blood - 3 tubes of it was needed <i class="fa-solid fa-syringe fa-beat fa-xl"></i>. 5 minutes later I back out on the street on my way home. Yes, we live within walking distance from the doctor's office. It's so convenient, made life so much easier when J. was a baby... The doctor called with the result this morning already with only good news - all perfect results. It was a relief.

						A quick note concerning some 3D printing <i style="font-size:x-large;" class="nf nf-md-printer_3d_nozzle_outline"></i> related stuff. I recently started a new little project that is interesting on multiple levels. It is basically to create my own sunglasses. I really like the design aspect as well as the technical challenges it brings. I will just mention it now, but I will absolutely cover this multiple times in a near future. It's because I need to document for my own reference as it is very much a work in progress, constantly working on perfecting the final solution. The tools used are OpenSCAD, FreeCAD and of course the 3D slicer of choice, the Prusa Slicer in this case. The parametrised, almost programming, way of working in OpenSCAD really interests me. Another cool aspect is scaling and also the tracing on top of an image to make the sketch needed when creating the 3D model in FreeCAD <i class="fa-solid fa-draw-polygon fa-xl" style="color: #000000;"></i>.

						Finally, after 2 years of negotiations, Sweden joins NATO. It was basically due to two egoistic countries/leaders/dictators that wanted to squeeze out as much as they possibly could. I don NOT understand how NATO could allow that kind of behaviour. Terrible! Anyway, in the end we all see what they go for and Turkey basically lost the initial F-16 deal with US and Erdogan never got the political refugees sent back from Sweden that he wanted. How Turkey is - with a dictator who carries out war crimes against Armenia etc - still a member of NATO escapes my mind! Interesting to know is that the main headquarters are located in Belgium (I can almost see it from my office window) and, what maybe you did not know, the military headquarters are also in Belgium, near Mons to be specific.

						Yesterday we started to watch a new Amazon Prime movie called "Knives out". It's one of those forgotten ones (at least for me) with only A-list actors. All of the actors are super famous, but the movie I just "forgot" about! It received great reviews on IMDB and I must agree that so far - we did not yet finish it - it is really good. I agree with the 7.9 (of 10) rating it has on IMDB.

						One of the chores on my list was to finally fix the pump in the pond, now and then it stops (most of the times it is simply clogged and it turns off automatically as a safety feature). While I was cleaning it, I notice that the hose between the pump to the filter (3 chamber filter) it cracks almost straight through. The first thought is that I have to turn it off until I buy a new 38 mm in diameter and 5 m long spiral reinforced pond hose. Then I started to analyse how I could fix it. As a temporary solution I decided to do as professionals - loads of Duct Tape. I found two types of Duct Tape and made sure <span class="tooltipimg">to use enough&nbsp;<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/2b/0e/JNz6DCdu_o.jpg" alt="pond reinforced spiral pond hose">It's working great, at least as a temporary fix! You can see that I have two types of Duct tape, the traditional silver coloured one and then I also used a black one. I am such a DIY guy ;-)</span></span> and it proved to work fine. At least until I have a new one. I checked the price online to get an idea of the price before I went to the local hardware store. Lucky that I did, the price is exactly double in the store, 50 EUR for a piece of hose!? I left it in the store (I do support local business, but I am not stupid) and went home to order it online (I also bought other stuff for the pond in preparation for the seasonal starting up).
