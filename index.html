						It was a particularly nice day today. Nice and relaxed Sunday breakfast with matching cup of coffee. The weather was super nice today, a bit too nice? Does it have to do with the fact that we are destroying it, or that earth is turning one second faster per year or is it simply that we are heading to a new ice age..? No matter what, today was a nice day!
					</p>
				
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We decided to go for a walk, while the earth is still spinning (too fast?), in one of the nice parks that we have here around the corner. It was a nice little walk (at least 6 km) through the forest to a shop where we could buy the dinner. We are doing a nNice piece of meat with Chinese cabbage (cooked in butter and olive oil, salt and pepper). No carbs tonight.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The open fire is has been lit and we feel the Sunday mood. It's certainly been a couple of days full of emotions, it feels almost like we've been on a 3 weeks holiday. In a way. A new university schedule is about to start which we have to align into.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						We will see what's on the horizon, what will tomorrow bring? I only wish that what ever it is, we have our health with us, that we are able to continue like my ever ongoing 3D prints..! <i style="font-size: 20px;" class="far fa-smile-wink fa-fw"></i>

						The last couple of days - luck for us that Friday was a public holiday - have been dedicated around arranging the practical stuff around Mokka's passing. We have been cleaning out and packed away all her stuff, getting it ready for donation. We decided to give it all away to the person/organization that cares for cats like Mokka.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday H and I decided to drop everything and enjoy the evening at a restaurant, the distraction was certainly needed with some cosy time. The food and drinks did wonders as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We had our friends A. and P. from The Netherlands over for lunch today. It was great sharing some laughs and silliness with our friends.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						It's strange how Mokka is still with us, it's almost that I can hear her sometimes. When I go down the stairs to get to the ground floor, I automatically look for her through the front door. For a split second I expect her to come running. Today I found flowers and a card placed where her little house used to stand. It was from "an animal lover". Not sure who that is, but I have my suspicion...

We had to take the difficult decision (by the strong recommendation of the veterinarian) to put her to sleep. Her health was declining rapidly (common with street cats) and she was starting to suffer.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						We are very sad at the moment, the wound is open and it is difficult to handle, she was a part of the family and now we have lost her. It's a small comfort that we made sure that the "second part" of her life was full of love and life quality.

						You know, the days when everything happens, when accumulated stuff falls into that one specific day.

						It's been a heavy day, a lot of stuff to be on top of. Taking the outcome, it was not a bad day at all. Exciting and challenging is how I would summarize it. Spice that with great batches of coffee and you'll be pretty close to my reality.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						A lot of frictions between teams to deal with, heavy duty project management and some coordination as well... that is what I had to deal with at work today. Again, not negative. In fact, it was really inspiring actually! I had to squeeze everything in today as I have taken tomorrow and Wednesday off. Friday is a public holiday here as well, so I do not have a lot of days to play with. One cool thing is the support that I had from my direct management, which made it a bit easier to deal with.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J had his first exam in the university today as well. Apparently it went OK, but impossible to judge exactly how good. Or even if the result was OK, could have gone either way...everything is new... so, we just have to wait and see. Another experience richer though.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						So for now, that is it. I just wanted to do a quick update on the very latest. Tomorrow is also an eventful day; a bit more studying/planning, try to take Mokka to the veterinarian and we will see how it goes with the Arborist appointment that is booked for tomorrow...

						It's been a special day today. As family were we separated in sa sense. Location wise we were together, yet separated. J. and H. did the studying (very much what J. and I did a couple of days ago) together while I did my stuff - writing, personal project planning (ok, that sounded very ambitious for hobby like activities), checking out a new backup solution (called URbackup <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.urbackup.org">here</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">I am not so convinced yet, I'll see what I will make of it.</span></i>) and caring for Mokka. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I wonder how she (our stray cat that we have adopted as our cat for the last ...oh 15 years I think) is really doing? She's been acting strange lately. We didn't think too much about it initially, but now she is getting "old" really fast. We have been talking of taking her to the vet to get her checked out. We'll see what happens, there is one really good vet that we know...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						OK, we ordered some Pizza for dinner a day like today. Everyone are tired and we needed it. Now time for bed...

						The busy work continued today and I could only stop just now. That makes the week, I am so glad it's Friday and weekend is here. I am looking forward to a shorter work-week next week with the public holiday on the 11th and the two days that I have taken off.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It's been a struggle at work, a lot of unnecessary noise and complaints to deal with. I do not understand how certain people think it's a good idea working against me, when it's in their interest to work with me. They have absolutely nothing to gain by being difficult <i style="font-size: 20px; color: darkred;font-weight: bold;" class="far fa-angry fa-fw"></i>... but, it's behind me for now. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Now, it's time to kick back and relax, enjoy a glass of wine <i style="font-size: 20px; color: green;" class="fa-solid fa-wine-glass"></i> and look forward to the weekend.

						Today was a day starting at 100% at work and kept on going full speed ahead until the late evening. Constant in calls and I had hardly time for anything else. The rest of the family were busy as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was a special night yesterday with our neighbour ladies. Special on so many levels that it's difficult to even put words to such an evening giving so many conflicting feelings. It spans from the positive news all to taking in the great ordeal that is also happening. Well, it needs to be sinking in for a while I guess. It's also comes at a time when there are other news that still sits with me. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We also recently started to think concretely on that this year we celebrate 20 years being married. Of course it's been ups and downs, but seeing the phot album today from that special day in December 2002 just makes it so obvious how right our gut feelings were. I am truly a lucky, lucky individual how things finally turned out!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						As a small little side project I decided to buy two domain names today with my trusted provider Namecheap again. Let's just say that I saved two of the most important dates - 21st of December 2002 and 14th of January 2014 - in my life. More to come...

I forgot to mention that we saw the recent movie called <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3704428/">Elvis</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it on IMDB. My mom, a huge fan of Elvis, will certainly love this movie. Austin Butler makes the performance of his life...</span></i> this evening. It's a fantastic movie that I can not recommend enough. Absolutely great!

						A new month today and we are rapidly getting closer to a new year. I can't believe that we are already in November. My older brother J turns 54 soon, which is also another proof on how fast time goes...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Plans changed a bit (=completely changed) today - it was a complete day of studying more Excel with J. It's not easy at all and some stuff I actually learned as well.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						We are visiting our neighbour ladies M and D this evening. Looking forward hearing how things are going with them and how it is progressing with D.

						Had a fantastic breakfast this morning, this day off - I bridged the day as it's a bank holiday tomorrow. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						The main activity planned for today is to guide J in his studying - an Excel exam is coming up soon. All the theory is done and the plan was to do some practical exercises in the afternoon. We started, but got interrupted as he needed to attend an online meeting. Hopefully, when we resume again, it will go a little bit smoother... <i style="font-size: 20px;color: darkred;" class="far fa-grimace fa-fw"></i>

There are more places and use cases at home - bathroom, laundry room etc - if it proves to be a good product. Seems promising; already after about an hour I could see some fluid collected in the tank. The daily limit for this - the smallest model in this range - is 250 ml.
