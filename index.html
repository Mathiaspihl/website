						It was difficult getting up this morning for the early calls, just one of those days when it is more difficult to wake up than normal. The magic of coffee changed that in a jiffy... 
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I was looking forward to finally have the fibre installed - just the last to connect and the setup of the router. That was scheduled for yesterday (I have lost the count on when they are supposed to come), but as it happens, they never turned up. Not even a message. Will they come today? No one knows, it seems. Customer support is something rare these days. Generally, the quality of service is really decreasing. Not sure why, but I notice this everywhere across different companies and segments. It's almost an exception to met with a friendly face or receiving the basic level of quality. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						One company that really stand out providing excellent service, is the online 3D printing shop of choice,&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">I ordered<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg img-myicons"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/46/b3/SoijJX8F_o.jpg" alt="3D printing filament PLA PETG">Always deliver great service and offering nice products!

It was nicely delivered and I also had a little gift included. How nice is that? But that is why I keep ordering from them.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Oh and just quickly, I just must mention the nice excursion last Sunday with the youths. As mentioned, we went to&nbsp;<span class="tooltipimg">the Royal botanic garden<i class="fa-regular fa-file-image fa-lg img-myicons"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/0d/20/amiW4jg1_o.jpg" alt="Royal botanic garden brussels">The Royal Botanic garden in Brussels.

It was really nice to find this lush green oasis in the middle of Brussels with an interesting history (dating back to 1874) and a unique setup (with plants and flowers that are 200 years old). It was a fantastic day with a nice restaurant visit before going home.

						It's been a very nice day today, I had the time and energy to do a lot of stuff that I wanted to do that I previously did not had the time for. Most are things that need some concentration or a certain focus that you can't rush into. Not like those things when you "oh, I have an hour free, let's start doing some...". I am talking about things like writing, more 3D printing projects (I just love&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.multiboard.io/">the Multiboard project</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">This is just one of the most comprehensive projects out there, the pegboard system covering almost 1000 parts. FANTASTIC!</span></i>) and buying equipment (I have 3D printed so much recently that the filament is running out), researching some needed spare parts around the house (the tumble dryer need a new filter and the washing machine need a new front panel to the soap-dispenser etc). So I today I could take some time for the things that I have been putting off for some time. Fantastic. 
					</p> 
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was the same for H.(she's been the garden gnome, German tutor and shopping specialist today) and J. (studying was the main-goal for today). We calmly exchanged loving greetings when passing each other in the garage (my 3D printing corner is there) or when our paths met in the garden (when I need my Zen moments). It was all very, and now I am searching for the words, Zen-balanced day today.  
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I left off a working week still with the satisfying feeling of achievement and appreciation. Ideally we all need a good balance of that. I think that must be the things we (I certainly do) fear the most when retiring. Correct? Anyway, on Thursday I learned that I was nominated for a global-wide award<i class="fa-solid fa-award fa-xl img-myicons" style="color: #f08c19;"></i>at work. I am keeping a down-to-earth view on it, but the most flattering feeling came from the person (who I respect the most at work) who nominated me. Enough about that now and we will see how it goes. By June I should know. 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow we are going to&nbsp;<i class="tooltiponly"><a href="https://www.koninklijke-serres-royales.be/">the Royal Greenhouse of Laeken</a>&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-link fa-lg"></i><span class="tooltiptextonly">I am looking forward to it so much. Not easy to get in there...</span></i> with J. and K. I am looking forward to it very much. It will be a whole day excursion with the 4 of us - the best!

						It's been a couple of days with 20-25 degrees (and that is according to Celsius), all of a sudden it was hot and humid. And no oxygen. Strange weather when celebrating (not really a proper celebration it here) Walpurgis Night.
					</p> 

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Anyway... A lot of interesting stuff happened; on an everyday family-social level we had the birthday celebration of granny (on the mother's side) turning 94 years old. It was all nice and relaxed with a family gathering in the middle of the week. But also I have had the time to produce some real nice 3D printing projects (using the brilliant Open SCAD tool. More to come for sure!!!). More to come!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Just as a little side-note, but still a pretty cool thing that I want to mention, especially for my personal reference. Today I learned that I have been nominated for an achievement award (global level). What makes it special are the persons who nominated me and of course (an added bonus) it's nice with the substantial amount of money that's on the stake... We'll see. I am already happy with the acknowledgement (from people who I really respect) so far...
