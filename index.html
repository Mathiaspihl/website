						I woke up this morning in my own bed and we enjoyed a very relaxed holiday morning. Even though it was a fantastic holiday, loved every second of it. Great plans and everything went perfectly. In fact, it was absolutely one of the best location in Sweden we stayed at. Despite all that, it is always nice to wakeup in your own bed again.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We are just back, unpacking and going through the practical stuff - closing off Sweden holiday and starting the preparations for the upcoming trip to Greece.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						In the last post, I stopped just before the Vasa museum excursion. It was as interesting as always. I believe it was my 3rd or 4th visit, but it's many years since last time. I think the youths also appreciated it as it's a very unique experience and impressive museum.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						As we were driving back after a full day in Stockholm, we started talking about where I grew up which is not too far away from where we were staying. We basically passed it when driving into Stockholm. J wanted to see it when I asked if I could pass by to show them. It was very interesting to see it again. I think it was 20 years ago since last time. It was great to show him the places and talk about memories as I was driving through the streets where I played as a kid. The coolest thing was when I stopped in front of the house my dad built in 1973 since I saw someone working in the garage. I presented myself and we talked for a little while. I asked if I could take some pictures and it turned out that the person I was talking with is one of the children to the woman who bought it from my parents in 1984...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						So after the Vasa museum and all the other memorable things happening, such as meeting up with friend E (drinks at rooftop bar and the dinner at Ångbåtsbryggan), enjoying Rosendal's garden (in the fruit-tree garden where also animals joined in on the great food served there) it was time for H's birthday celebration. I had planned some things in all secrecy together with J and K (I even had some time the day before to find something extra for my wonderful wife). The greatest thing of all is that all the plans, everything we planned in the day just turned out perfectly! From in the early morning until in the late night everything was just perfect. The morning birthday song with all of us, the day excursion to <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://artipelag.se/om-artipelag/">Artipelag</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The owner of Baby Björn founded this place, read more about it on the home page.</span></i>. The spectacular exhibition, in true honor of H, was Monet. When the youth went on their own, we went on our own to visit  <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Eugen,_Duke_of_N%C3%A4rke">Prince Eugen</a><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about this very interesting person on Wikipedia.</span></i> palace at Waldemarsudde (extremely interesting person). We ended the day with drinks at Oumi (fantastic place in Old Town) and then the surprise dinner at <i class="tooltipimg">Movitz <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/97/97/dVuEvA8m_o.jpg">Brilliant restaurant in Old Town of Stockholm!</span></i> (in Old Town). The atmosphere reached an almost magic level, the food and service to match! 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						The following day was the very last in Sweden. We cleaned up, packed our stuff into the suitcases stuffed them in the rental car (Opel Mokka, in memory of our little lady cat). The last excursion was a nice lunch in Vaxholm before we had to hurry to Bromma airport. One very memorable holiday! 
					</p>

						We are really enjoying the days in Sweden, exploring the sights in and around Stockholm. We are really trying to keep the balance between getting out as much as possible of every day but still keep it relaxed and enjoy it as much as possible. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We took a boat out to Fjäderholmarna and had a great lunch at "Röda Villan", we spent a day in Sandhamn (took the boat from Stavsnäs). We also met up with family and friends; visited my younger brother in Bromma, we drove up to Sågtäkten (outside Hudiksvall) to visit my parents and older brother. Yesterday we met up with friend E for a drink at Bank and the rooftop bar and had a fantastic dinner in the restaurant called Ångbåtsbryggan on Strandvägen. Other cool places and things that stood out was the dinner at Grodan (the one at the royal opera house), cold drinks at the Icebar to celebrate J's girlfriend K's 20th birthday.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Apart from all the sightseeing, we are enjoying the fantastic views where we live in the nature close to a spectacular view of water. The view of the sea gives a special feeling! OK, we are getting ready for another day in Stockholm, the Vasa museum is one of the planned activities...

J guided them around the sights in Stockholm and only sporadically we met up all together here and there. It was an absolutely fantastic day which created memories for life!

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We have been very lucky with the Airbnb house that we rented, the location is great. The house is placed elevated which gives a spectacular view of the sea and we are secluded only surrounded by lush nature.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Today on the schedule is a visit to "Wira bruk" for a quick lunch (very quick if we follow the tempo of the youth) and then we are off to meet up with my brother N. and family. There awaits a gruesome tournament of Kubb <i class="fa-regular fa-face-laugh-wink fa-xl"></i> followed by a BBQ (if I understand the planning well).

That reminds me, I have to fly up with the drone to check the roof and the solar panels as soon it's calmed down.

						We heard from J last evening. It's so great to hear from him and all their adventures together, his thoughts and ideas. Stories like the extremely friendly one legged Swedish 39 year old that they felt sorry for and who's been with them the last couple of days. Or the story about when some of the guys - since they did not took the short-cut - got apprehended by the very corrupted police there. After they payed 500€, they got their bikes back and were released. But also hearing his thoughts around how he is thinking about the future trips. Very interesting to hear...

						I also have some sad news, one of my Koi fishes - the doitsu-like one - is dead. We found him floating in the pond this morning. It's the one that got sick some time ago (even though I thought he was looking much better). Last time I fed them he did not come up and I remember that I was wondering how he was doing. It's really sad, I reckon he's been with us for about 10-15 years. I will look for pictures of him and post later.

						Another month has started. And it started good, busy but good, I must say. I must say that June ended even more busy than July begun... We are just back from Utrecht after a very nice time with our Dutch friends A and P. It was especially nice this time, we can really talk open and freely with them. Very special friends!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was "planned" on Friday that J would arrive home (somewhere) during the day. He had been away for a couple of days celebrating his girlfriend's birthday. The problem was that I had an appointment in Brussels on Friday to ..ehum.. change tyres. Yes, into summer tyres. It's a long story starting in February of this year with the accident I had that took months to fix, two missed appointments at the garage...let's leave it at that. I left early to be on time for the appointment... it ended that I was 10 minutes late after have been stuck in traffic on the ring of Antwerp for an hour. I was clearly not going to be able to keep the strict schedule so J got picked up by H while I was waiting to get the tyres fitted.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						All worked out fine, J and H arrived safely at home. I finally got the tyres and after another 2 hours in traffic (two accidents on the ring of Antwerp going back) I arrived home and could finally hug and connect with J again. Yes, it doesn't stop there. J was going to a friend the same evening where all his friends would come together to catch a very early flight from Rotterdam to Spain the following morning. We had a very limited time to spend some quality time with our son. The final packing for the trip had to be done too. Well, then all of a sudden we had to let him go again. Now he is away again for a week. Tough to be a parent!
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Tomorrow we have another appointment with friends. It's been changed, postponed, cancelled, Changed.... for months. Now finally we all meet up at our place for a lunch. There are people there that I have not seen in years...how about 10 years, I think?
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I also have to mention something about upcoming plans. It just hit me that next week is my last working week before our holiday. It will start by us going to my home country Sweden for 9 days together with J and K. We have an Airbnb there outside Stockholm, arranged for a rental car for the time to be able to move around freely. Mobility is so important, maybe the most important ingredient for a successful holiday. OK, then after Sweden, we have booked a real close family trip to Greece again. This time to the mainland but with the same travel agency - the concept of Flight, stay and rental car. Again; flexibility and mobility. Mobility!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Well, that is it. Now it's time to zoom out for a second and then go to bed...
