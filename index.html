						Today was a different day, not sure where it went. Completely crazy how fast it went! On top of it, or maybe just because of it, it's a Sunday and that why it felt even faster. Enough with the theory. The weather was again brilliant today which was nice to enjoy but made it difficult for J to focus on studying. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I was busy most of the day trying to resolve the issue with my network <i class="fa-solid fa-network-wired fa-xl"></i>  which happened after the technician was here from Proximus. It took some time before I figured out what the root cause is, slowly but steadily I could tick off the issues from the list. Satisfying on one hand, but frustrating at the same time as it's very time consuming thing to work with. Long and complicated story, but all came down to that my private network was moved to a different subnet, with a different network mask. If the technician would have told me, my life would have been much easier. Basically, I was busy fixing the conflicts, moving my devices into the correct IP range, fixing local web applications (<i class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.opendocman.com/free-download/">Opendocman</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">Read more about it here on the homepage.</span></i> was especially a struggle), setting up the media computer with all its dependencies and services.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Luckily I could alternate the geeky stuff with enjoying the weather sitting in the garden, study support to J and doing some chores around the house and other planned obligations.
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Tomorrow is a big day for J, he has his first exam (something like within business financial) for this period. It seems he has a good understanding of the content, but again with no margin over and his plan is to study until the last second. I really hope he does well, he deserves it! If he would have followed some of the plans from us he would not be in such a stress now... Sorry, just saying.

						What beautiful days we're having here, the weather is fantastic. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Friday ended with spending hours to fix out home network and internet as I had to get a technician over from Proximus to resolve the issue that I struggled with most of the day. It resulted in a new modem/router and also a brand new Wifi "booster". We should have great coverage now! What the technician forgot to mention is that I have now a complete new internet service, new network with completely new IP ranges and LAN services. Probably he didn't know my network setup. Not a lot of people have this setup at home. We never stop learning... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						We enjoyed an absolute fantastic evening last night with son J and his girl friend K. We received the great gift from K (how cool is that) of a "candle light concert". Indeed, what is that? It's a trio playing classic instruments and this performance they covered Queen songs with their normal violin, an alt violin and a cello. Imagine all this happening in a church hall covered with live lights. Absolutely spectacular! The experience only got better with the fabulous interaction that they had with the crowd! Later, when we walked back to the car through the city of Antwerp, it was pure magic. The parents went back home together with a huge smile, J and K stayed. We both enjoyed a perfect evening, a memory for life! 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						I have just completed a very satisfying 3D print, a bag clamp. It only took 1 hour with a perfect result. Another very satisfying thing was that I send away the remote control to get my DJI remote control repaired. Not sure if I mentioned it, but it just stopped working and I can not for the life of me understand why it happened. I am very curious how that will work out...  
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						Anyway people, I really have to go to bed. Last night was very late, I could not enjoy the bed before 2 am as I was trying to fix some of the network issues I still struggled with after the Proximus technician was here...

					<p class="main">
						I was cleaning up and freeing up some additional disk space on one of my Raspberry Pi's - the one that is running a surveillance camera like system. It's based on the Python solution referred as <i class="tooltip"><a href="https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en">Picamera</a> <i class="fas fa-link"></i><span class="tooltiptext">The fantastic Picamera Python solution.</span></i>. Basically a picture is taken and stored every time a movement is detected.

The movie is moved into a folder acting as a temporary holding location on the SD card. Now and then I have to archive these short movies to my hard drive on the PC to free up some storage. To have these recordings has proven to be very useful, now and then I have a look and detect interesting things. So, the other day I <i class="tooltipimg">saw myself <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/04/bf/Nwa2O55g_o.jpg">There I was, trying out the car washing accessory for the high pressure cleaner.

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Yesterday we received the terrible news that the cutest little dog of my parents have an incurable disease. To make it worse she - yes, the dog called Emma is a she - will not have the means of continuing leading a life without discomfort and pain. We took it very hard <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-crack fa-xl" style="color: #f70202;"></i> as we can relate having received similar shocking news about our cat Mokka not too long ago. We also had no real other alternatives than to put her to sleep. Thoughts goes out to my parents, we wish you all the strength! 
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I was going to fly with my drone yesterday, but the remote controller didn't start up. The lights that indicates the battery charge status didn't even lit up. I thought it was simply a sign that I had to charge it. But the situation did not change after I charged the battery, all the 5 lights are indicating the charging progress while charging. But only while the charge cable is attached. It's really a mystery what happened, from working perfectly the last time then I put it away (in it's dedicated place, safe in a box) and a couple of days later, it is not even powering on when I try to turn it on. I was in contact with DJI support who went through the debugging steps (I even had to send a video clip on how it is getting charged and how I try to power it on). The person at support suggested me to send <i class="fa-solid fa-truck-fast fa-xl"></i> it in for inspection (it will be free if they don't rule a user error as the warranty is still active). This morning I went through all the steps of completing an online repair service form. Hopefully within 2 days I will receive a shipping tag that I can use. Interesting...

						We continue the day living with the youth (carefully balancing the contact with them but still allowing them their privacy) at home. They are both studying next to each other in their rhythm. We love having them around of course, but it's also a change that we have to adopt to. Even though a very nice change <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-hearts fa-xl" style="color: #cf2102;"></i>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						There have been some days before last update. Time goes so fast and it seems it is only accelerating. I worked in the office in Brussels on last Friday, it's nice (except the aspect of the traffic situation of course) to meet some of the colleagues. Then in the evening we went to have dinner with friend K and his new boyfriend K. It was very nice meeting up with them and they are a very nice couple. On Saturday we were very productive, cleaned the drive way with the high-pressure cleaner. I purposely planned it so that I also could use the accessory I bough for the machine - a car cleaning nozzle. <i class="tooltipimg">The result<i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/9e/5e/MiP3HycS_o.jpg">The result is good, but still room for improvement.

						It was a cool day today, a slow yet busy workday if you know what I mean. It's been a lot to do but enough time in between to focus on them. I even had the time to do some hardcore development in Oracle creating SQL queries. Anyway, geekness...
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Otherwise, there are a lot of noise everywhere and we have to filter to be able to upright a healthy work-family-social life. It is busy enough in our lives. Like today our neighbours installed solar panels and all of a sudden the trucks and equipment pulled up in our street. It's already tight as is, so we were surprised that there were no communication done about it. We started communicating a week before for the neighbours to have time to plan well in time. Anyway, it proves that people are egoistic at core, right?

						I mentioned about the local Stable Diffusion AI installation earlier, right? I have tried to install it on two computers - one Windows and one Linux based. Both were unsuccessful and I am pretty sure it has to do with the hardware (all to do with the lack of decent GPU). Anyway, I have one last resort, the gaming machine of my son. I have to sneak into the gaming room and do it at some point in time. Me being Ninja thus. But just to see if it works...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						The coolest things today, most inspiring what happened today though, was when J arrived home and started to talk about his lesson and the person who was invited in todays presentation. It was a day-trader that told them about what he is doing. Of course it's very impressing for a 19 year old to hear that a 20+ year old person could make 200K Euro in a day (or loosing 50K in one minute). They were so impressed it led to private talks afterwards. It is fascinating to see his reactions and his reasoning. I learn a lot!

						Today was was a great day, both at work and later at home. Imagine that you can look forward to water the garden (and I connected my water tank to the pump. It always gives that added satisfaction feeling. Like charging the car from solar energy...), never take the simple things in life for granted. It can all change in minutes. Also, J came home this morning and studied most of the day. He really kept to a schedule and we, like the good old days, threw some baseball in the garden. The perks of life again!

						I had a presentation to do early this morning and it was a very satisfying session with a lot of constructive response and feedback coming from a very high level. It is very inspiring and I can really get energised by those moments, the preparation done last night makes it all worth it!

						Oh, before I forget and also before my brain goes on strike, during lunch today I watch an interesting YouTube clip about the open source graphical AI generator called Stable Diffusion Web UI (<i>Automatic 1111</i> on Github).

						To honour the upcoming National Barbecue Day (not true, I did not know that today is the day) we did the first BBQ of the season this weekend.

						As a follow up on the latest 3D printing project, the second related to my drone, namely the travel-box for my drone. Overall it is a nice 3D model that fits my needs perfectly - I want to be able to bring the drone safely in a backpack etc. I downloaded it from Printables.com and it 3D printed fine, no major issues to speak of at all. However, after a short while the lock of the lid broke off. I re-printed the lid (in different orientation thinking it could be stronger) but it soon broke. I decided to redesign the STL file in Tinkercad - it's the easiest way of doing some quick modifications on already created STL files. <i class="tooltipimg">The travel-box <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/55/a1/AKfVH5NB_o.jpg">It's a really nice little travel box that fits my DJI Mini 2 se drone perfectly.

						Typical - well, what is typical - Sunday today with J and K at home. I was amazed that I could fall back in sleep this morning when I first woke up and could really sleep in. Fantastic! Since I was working yesterday, I am completely messed up on the days. Feels like Saturday today...
					</p>
					
					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was really a successful working day yesterday. But it took much longer than expected, I wasn't done before around 17:00. I decided to enjoy outside, I jumped on the bicycle and headed into one of the parks. I had my drone with me and found a great spot where I could fly. The weather was however really unstable, but I could fly between the rain showers. Got some nice recording from it as well!
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						The plan is to take the time to do some stuff at home, probably driving K to the train, maybe some writing and hopefully there will be some time for 3D printing as well. Let's see what the day brings...

						Today is a strange and different Saturday, it will be a different weekend in fact. It started this morning when I had to logon to work. We have to make a physical database <i class="fa-solid fa-database fa-lg"></i> move in the data center in Germany and some other things. That is always a scary task to do, especially when the database is 2 TB and on two servers. That was this morning, we are still busy working on it. We ran into some problems that needed fixing and it is "normal" that things take longer than expected on complex setups like these.

I am basically shielded off in in the office at home constantly wearing the headphones.

						It was difficult to wake up today, luckily the first call was not that early. I have felt reluctant to drive to the office lately due to overwhelmingly much to do and also due to the extreme traffic situation lately. The other day I was driving to the car repair shop, which normally takes about 25 minutes. It took more than 2 hours and it felt like I had to drive through half of Belgium to get there. I do not mind the driving per se, it's more to be in time for calls (not all of them can be done in the car as I need access to the computer etc) and to be home in a decent time.
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						J had an exam today in supply chain and I really wonder how it went! Apparently the feeling was not that good (one mistake can have a huge impact), but to be expected as the preparation was limited (to say the least). Anyway, let's hope for the best...
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						I checked the open source version of ChatGPT (the very popular chat and language interpretation technology using artificial intelligence and machine learning) called Open Assistant. It's completely free and I have seen a YouTube clip and read an article about it which triggered my curiosity. The initial tests I did on the website shows a promising result but I have to try it some more.

						Just back from Antwerp. We have just seen M - the daughter of friends M and W - perform ballet. It was the yearly dance performance that the group arranges. Before the show we had dinner together, it was nice meeting them all and to see how good she is in dancing. Of course there are some who are painfully bad, but it certainly did not take away the experience and the positive atmosphere. J and K are not home yet, we expect them home any minute now. Now off to bed.

						No, I did not fall off the face of the earth. But so much is going on lately that it is difficult to keep track on priorities. It's all being processed as it comes... and of course not according to priorities in most cases. But that is to be expected I guess, when there are so many moving targets at the moment. 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						"Moving targets" is a good word, it's really been forget everything and see how it plays out. Today we can finally have our own evening. J studied the whole day (more like 2 hours) for the exam tomorrow (he studied "supply chain" a couple of hours). It is fantastic to see talk with him about it, amazing how much he picks up in such a short time. I wonder if he understand that supply chain is what I have been working with for about 25 years... 
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						It was fantastic that I could do some drone flying today. I could explore how to take <i class="tooltipimg">pictures <i class="fas fa-image"></i><span class="tooltiptextimg"><img width="400px" src="https://images2.imgbox.com/fe/b4/znuVCiIj_o.jpg">This were one of the pictures that I took.

Well, the flight was about 25 minutes (had already used some battery while discovering how to stream video to the network).
					</p>

					<p class="main" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Well anyway, feels like it is Friday already here but now it is time to go to bed. We had a lot happening the last couple of days (in a near future I might have some very special to share in silence). The day in Antwerp with family was very nice. One day I also had to go back to the garage where they fixed the car after the accident (I think I mentioned that they forgot to mount a panel under the hood). It should finally be OK now, but what about the quality control?
					</p>

					<p class="main">
						For now that has to be it. A lot is also going on at work, the travel to Dubai is one example that is still lingering on but should probably be fine. It is to be expected in such a huge project. Anyways, now it is time to go to bed for sure...

						It's been some time - three days - that I posted something here. It seems that something always comes in between. Anyway, today we are off to Antwerp with the family to do some sight-seeing/city exploration all of us. It's something the city is arranging; a tour around the high-lights of the city with questions about what you see. If you complete the questioner form you have the chance of winning a price. Not sure what it is though, but that is not why we participate. At least not most of us...

						Just as a little side-note, I am exploring and comparing some new and existing CMS systems and what would be the best workflow/solution when developing and maintaining content of websites. An overall efficient workflow I value the highest. It's a very interesting topic and something that is constantly changing with the rapid development in that area. Especially now also with the ever so popular AI and ML technology popping up like mushrooms. Hugo, Grav, Netlify CMS are some of the products that I wanted to mention for now. I updated my Bookmark page with some interesting resources.
